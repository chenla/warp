#+begin_quote
My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call
'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly
criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the
psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype'
is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite
mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more
than conscious representations. Such variable
representations cannot be inherited. The archetype is a
tendency to form such representations of a
motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail
without losing their basic pattern.

— Carl Jung, Man and His Symbols
