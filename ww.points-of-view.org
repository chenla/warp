** TL;DR

   - Point of View
   - Level of Detail (LOD)   -> scale
   - Rate of Change (ROC)    -> velocity and direction
   - Process of Change (POC) -> as a system


*** What is a point of View?


In philosophy a point of view (POV) is a "stated matter of
consideration", taken from an individual's perspective. In this sense
a POV is entirely subjective.  But a POV can also be seen as something
that at least theoretically is objective.

In physics, and in particular, the Theory of Relativity, everything is
understood to what can be observed from a particular time and place,
or more specifically an /inertial frame of reference/.  

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference

This is the point in time or space where the observer is looking and
everything that is observed is relative to that position.  If
something is close or far away, or fast or slow all depends on if the
observer is traveling at the same speed and direction as what is being
observed, which means that from that POV both the observer and the
observed are stationary relative to each other.


From wikipedia -- Propositional attitudes:

  The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed similarly
  to the concept of a propositional attitude. A propositional attitude
  is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a
  proposition.
   -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy)

POVs are critical to the concept of a worldview.

A World View is a mental model of the world that establishes cognitive
orientation for where you are relative to the world.  Worldviews are a
mixture of memories of things observed and experenced, assertations of
what those things are and mean, and conjecture that fill in the blanks
in that model.  If you are in a room that has a door that you have
never seen opened, you will include in your mental model the
conjecture that there is either a room leading to another room or
corrider in the building or that it is an outside wall that will take
you outside the building.  There is also the possibility that it is a
fake door that doesn't open or lead to anywhere.  Worldviews are full
of such conjectures that are constantly being updated and expanded as
more information is added to the model.

The maker of the model is always at the center of the model -- I am
here and the rest of the universe radiates out from where I am at any
given moment.

This is the case for pretty much anything animal that has a brain, as
well as groups, an ant colony has a collective worldview as much as
a group of close friends, a department in a company, a government, a
church congregation or even a religion that spans the globe.

Collective POVs are, by definition, limited to a specific way of
looking at something -- without this, communication and cooperation is
at best difficult and in many cases, impossible.

When we make rules for a group to follow, those rules first define the
POV that all members choose to observe from.  Without this, agreeing
on what is right or wrong, or even what is true or false is not
possible.

Different cultures are based in part on their relationship that that
culture has to the environment.  For someone living in a cold climate
with harsh winters and short intense summers, they will have a very
different view of nature than someone who has grown up in a mild
semi-tropical climate where the ocean is calm, and the night pleasant
and the the length of the day and night seldom differs over the year
more than an hour or so.  These POVs shape not only how you feel about
nature, but how you design a house, what kinds of clothes you wear,
the kinds of food that you will have access to and how you can cook
it.  Before refridgeration, it was, and still is common to overcook
food so that it can survive longer in the heat.  People from cold
countries or who have refridgerators don't undertand why people in the
tropics would cook a piece of meat until it approached the toughness
of shoe leather.  But this makes perfect sense if you want to cook for
many people who may eat at different times of the day.  You need
cooked food that won't go bad in severe heat in a couple of hours or
overnight.


*** POV as a cognitive tool

A POV is a useful way of understanding the world -- in fact it is
important to always consciously considered things from different
perspectives.  In colloquial english it's common to hear phrases such
as:

  - Thinking out of the box
  - Put yourself in my shoes
  - From where I am sitting....

These are all different ways of telling others or reminding yourself
that your POV is not the only way of seeing something, and that it is
useful to see things from a different perspective.

It's one things to say this, but it's another to actually do it.  How
do you think out of the box?  How do you put yourself in another
person's shoes and see the world as they do?

The answer you will get, more often than not, is to use your
imagination to create a different model based on how you imagine
someone else might see the world and put yourself at the center of it
and extrapolate how that POV would differ from yours.

This goes to the heart of empathy -- as a general rule, unless you are
unfortunate to be a sociopath or psychopath, empathy makes human
relationships possible.  In fact, the very definition of a person who
is totally disfunctional in a society is a sociopath or psychopath
which are defined as persons who can not feel empathy.

Problem solving in large part is a skill that requires a person to
understand a problem from different perspectives -- thinking out of
the box is the process of creating a mental model of something and
imagining how it looks from multiple POVs.  Pretty much every
innovation or advancement in human understanding has been the result
of this process.

*** Defining objective POVs

It would be helpful if generic POVs could be objectively defined in a
way that they could be used to understand and used by anyone without
having to resort to subjective imagination or empathy which are often
so intertwined with emotional states, cognitive limitations and biases
that they are difficult to use as general purpose empirical-based
cognitive tools.

We have identified what we believe to be three fundamentally important
types of POVs which can do just that.  And because of the importance
that POVs have in the survival of a species, and as a culture and
civilization we are putting these three POVs at the center of
understanding who we are, where we came from, how to overcome
cognitive limits and bias, problem solving, communication, conflict
resolution and cooperation.

But before we can introduce the three core POVs we will need to
introduce three concepts, each of which will be the core of a Core
POV, but also are critical understanding any one of the three POVS.
These are, Level of Detail, Rate of Change, and Process of Change.
