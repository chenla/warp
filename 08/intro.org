** Scope

Mythos is the foundation for languages -- you can't have one
without the other. Lingua francas are always based on
networks and in particular empires which are more or less,
networks.

** TL;DR

On the face of it, the story of the fall of the Tower of
Babel is a pourquoi story, providing a backstory for why
there are so many different human languages.  The story has
always captured people's imagination, if for no other reason
that in the story, God is not so much punishing Man, but
making a premptive strike against man, who had eaten from
the tree of knowledge and was then ejected from the Garden.
In the destruction of the Tower God shows that he (the Old
Testement always potrays their God as masculine) what he was
scared of most was what Man would do with that knowledge --
cooperate.  And by cooperating Man collectively would be
able to challenge God.  The implication is that the source
of God's power is knowledge. By detroying the Tower and
fragmenting a single common language into many, it would
make the type of cooperation needed to challenge God's
knowledge and power impossible.
