** TL;DR

In one sense humans are in the same boat as the animals and
plants that we have domesticated (or, depending on your POV,
who have domesticated us) SEE Michael Pollan

Corn is the hero of its own story, and though we humans
played a crucial supporting role in its rise to world
domination, it would be wrong to suggest we have been
calling the shots, or acting always in our own best
interests. Indeed, there is every reason to believe that
corn has succeeded in domesticating us.  To some extent this
holds true for all of the plants and animals that take part
in the grand coevolutionary bargain with humans we call
agriculture. Though we insist on speaking of the "invention"
of agriculture as if it were our idea, like double-entry
bookkeeping or the lightbulb, in fact it makes just as much
sense to regard agriculture as a brilliant (if unconscious)
evolutionary strategy on the part of the plants and animals
involved to get us to advance their interests. By evolving
certain traits we happen to regard as desirable, these
species got themselves noticed by the one mammal in a
position not only to spread their genes around the world,
but to remake vast swathes of that world in the image of the
plants' preferred habitat. No other group of species gained
more from their association with humans than the edible
grasses, and no grass has reaped more from agriculture than
/Zea mays/, today the world's most important cereal crop.

That in all cases, for plants, animals, ourselves and soon
the cognitive machines which will soon join us, that we need
to stop thinking in terms of exploition and start thinking
of finding ways of maximizing whatever their natures are,
that give them a fulfilled life and leverage what those
things are to do the work of ecosystems and our
civilization.

Work doesn't have to be exploitive, but provides purpose and
meaning to our lives.  When we give people, animal, plants
and machines that opportunity, we can achieve all of our
goals

These are positive-sum scenarios -- exploitation is zero-sum
wasteful and expensive.  There is no justification for
zero-sum exploitation if you have a positive-sum alternative
that works better..

   the thing is though, that ultimately, we human's, by
   accepting this principle, are not exempt from it being
   applied to us in the future -- I'm not talking about
   those that have used this tact to justify slavery, by
   claiming that the enslaved are too stupid to know better
   and are content being enslaved -- it would have to work
   at the level where humans would be free to do pretty much
   anything they want, not be limmited by what others claim
   is what they want.

Any semi, or self-directed entity capable of producing
wealth that is controlled or effectively owned by another
entity whose wealth self-propagates to the controlling
entity.

In this sense, a slave is functionally no different from an
employee except in degree.  State supported slavery, is only
different from incarcerated people in that a person in
prison, in theory is only enslaved for a proscribed period
of time, which is also the case for indenture, tennent
farmers etc.

This system was very crude and not very flexible.  The
industrial age changed this because production was depended
solely on human labour with the use of tools.  Industrial
labor had machines which are largely large expensive fixed
assets.  Such production needed a more flexible workforce to
operate these machines, and since slavery was based largely on
unskilled labor, didn't work with  semi-skilled labor
required to operate machinery.  In many cases, this creates
a captive labor pool where whole towns and even cities are
dependent on one or more factories.  Workers are not
educated enough to move up the ladder to white collar work,
and family pressure keeps them from moving to another city.

---

The problem is that unless a factory is effectively owned by
it's workers, there is no mechanism for workers to be able
to not effectively be slaves. The wealth they create is not
theirs.

Famously, the person who invented the Post-It made millions
for 3M, but didn't receive so much as a salary bonus from
the company.

--- 

This is the opposite of egalitarian systems, where wealth
created by individuals in a group is shared, but those who
create the wealth benifit from it.  This is fair because
pooling your efforts you will benifit when say, you are sick
and can't produce, or your hunting party was unable to find
any prey that day, but another party did.

** Slavery and Civilization

All employment at scale has at its roots, human slavery. I
realize that at first this sounds like an inflammatory
statement, but it's not.  Once you grow a group beyond the
scale of a band or small tribe, you slavery begins to
emerge.  This is universal, it cuts across all human
societies and religions and ideologies (tho religion is a
subset of ideology).

---

Two sides to slavery; surplus mind and muscle, you need both
to create a surplus that leads to surpluses that free a
proportion of the population to pursue intellectual pursuits
that result in advancements in technology, sciences and the
arts.

This follows toffler: 

    force -> wealth -> knowledge

Human labour at scale mirrors this perfectly: 

    slave/convict -> indenture/conscript -> employee

At each level labour becomes more abstract, flexible and
more powerful, but at base it's jelly beans, they might all
have different pretty colors but inside it's all made up of
the same sugary crap.

My argument here is that labour does not and can not scale
without it becoming a manifestation of slavery.


  - domesticated animals had the muscle but not the mind so
    you still needed slaves who were compelled through
    physical force to direct the beasts.  people submited to
    slavery because of fear of physical force.

  - machines had the muscle but not the mind so you needed
    captive labour in the form of factory workers who were
    economically compelled to work to direct the machines.
    This system is more flexible and scalable than slavery.
    people submited to industrial factory jobs because of
    fear of poverty.  after poverty was largely taken out of
    the equation other fears were leverages -- leveraing
    fear is how to keep slaves in line.  keep them dumb,
    control what information they have access to, keep them
    scared and then give them cheap consumer goods so that
    they produce and consume as they are told.

  - when you use machine cognition to direct the machines
    you get robots which does not require compelled human
    labor.  Ths system is more flexible and scalable than
    mass indusitural human labor.

So when you hear claims that it was machines that were responsible for
ending slavery they are both right and wrong.  The nature of slavery
simply changed from a model based on physical force, to a model based
on symbolic wealth.  The work force might have the illusion of being
free but for all practical purposes it was still slavery.  This then
frames the other claim that it was the development of moral and
ethical motivations that ended slavery.  Those moral arguements were
used to change the nature of slavery, not to end it.  And in so doing
was able to scale slavery to proportions that couldn't have been
dreamed of in the wildest dreams of the most barbaric banna
plantation in central America or Cotton farm in the old south.

However, even before 1800 it's difficult to know how many slaves there
were because not all slaves were called slaves.  Serf's, indentured
labor etc. are all forms of the same shade.  This is also true in the
modern industrial era where incarceration in many places is little
more than another form of legal slavery.  Conscription has also taken
forms that are little different from slavery as well.
