** Scope
** TL;DR
 - rules>paradigm  cite:keep:2018science-high-modernism
   cite:keep:2017rationional-animal
   concrete>abtract

   start with list of observations
   then list of rules
   a perfect rule system is never created
   then a theory that everyone get's behind which becomes a
   paradigm

   when anomolies in the paradigm become too much and people
   are reduced to frantic rule-based theorizing

   if what we are trying in w&w is to describe a paradigm,
   with no rules, then we must do so by laboriously
   exhaustively go through examples that eventually explain
   the paradigm

   this creates models and results that can be tested
   against, not theory

   then go into case-law

   and finally the problem of making our new paradigm
   machine understandable  --- fuck me....
   -- I think that it boils down to algorthms for matching
   patterns rather than logical step-wise rules.

   Alexander uses patterns as a way of describing a
   paradigm, but few people really /got it/ because his
   paradigm hadn't been accepted by the community he was
   trying to convince -- mostly because they didn't engage
   with him.  

   This is an imporant lession -- if you can't people to
   engage in your paradigm you are fucked and will be
   forgotten.

   Nature of Order was an attempt to correct this, but came
   off as a list of rules that should have been the
   precursor to APL -- it didn't work either, but laid the
   groundwork for a much deeper and substantial paradigm
   which he could only partially articulate.

   Mollison's back-of-book outline for a new civilization is
   given as a list of rules -- he had already done an
   excellent job teaching the permaculture paradigm as
   patterns and examples, the end of the book was just a
   starting point for what I'm doing and what will have to
   be done by others who come after me.

   Perhaps if APL was vastly expanded so that each pattern
   had an exhaustive list of examples showing what almost
   works and what works and how others fail when trying to
   use the pattern would have made it more useful than
   Nature of Order --  Nature of Order moved is almost an
   entirely different paradigm from APL -- is APL metis?

   Soleri gave us a paradigm with little to no map to
   understand it, let alone test against it.

   I think this is where Engelbart fell down as well -- he
   was too far ahead of everyone that they couldn't
   understand how to engage, let alone test against --
   Engelbart took the Bush essay and built a framework to
   build it in the 20th century using networked computers --
   it just completely went over people's heads and still
   does today....


#+begin_quote
Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men
have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of
their inability to tolerate crisis. Like artists, creative
scientists must occasionally be able to live in a world out
of joint—elsewhere I have described that necessity as “the
essential tension” implicit in scientific research.

— kuhn
