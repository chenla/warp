** TL;DR

w&w -> patterns -> keystone reference -> design -> instance

This section is all about the different ways that designs are turned
into instances which are exemplar's of that design.



A large part of this will talk about communications, 


** Table of Contents


  - Replication
    - manufacturing
    - biological
    - information
  - Methods of Replication
    - Clone        -> duplicate
    - Grow         -> seccession
    - Fabricate    -> fashion out of raw materials
    - Recombinate  -> merge two variations as in DNA
    - Division     -> as in cell division
    - Assimilation -> additive
  - Tolerances
    In copying, what are the tolerances or amount of variation that is
    allowable for it to be considered a faithful, exact, or rough copy
    of something.  This is an important part of the design or
    specification for what is being replicated.  In the case of many
    things including living organisms or machines with moving parts,
    if tolerances are exceeded, the machine won't work or the organism
    will not survive.  
  - Copy errors
    entropy and complexity makes errors inevitable
    - mutations
    - flaws
    - impurities
    - noise
  - Error Detection
    - comparison with reference instance
    - checksums
    - QA tests
  - Error Correction
    - Redundancy
      - example: QR Code
  - Introducing Error
    - bombard dna with radiation to produce mutations
