** TL;DR

The Primer, despite its name, is not actually meant for use
by end-users.  The Primer builds Pattern Language for
generating a Hoard which will be a sort of Application
(tho that term is to be used extremely loosely that will
start from the assumption that the user has nothing, not
even the means for basic survival.

It will start as simple pictographs asking basic questions
such as, do you have food?  Can you make fire? Do you have a
shelter? Can you read? etc. and then guide the user through
eachh step until they have mastered basic survival and have
surplus time to learn more.  The system will be, in some
respects similar to "The Young Ladies Illustrated Primer" in
Neal Stephenson's novel /The Diamond Age/, but instead of
targeting pre-teen girls, it will target anyone, even if
they are living through a Mad Max post-apocolypse scenario.

The system will determine what level of civilization that
you are currently living in, and unlock all levels up to the
level that you are in and start from there.

The Hoard, which is generated from the Primer, is not merely
an instructional device, but a complete infrastructure for
building and maintaining a post-scarcity distributed
multi-planet civilization. If you are laughing right now,
good.  As I write this, of course we don't have a
post-scarcity distributed multi-planet civilization.  You
might well imagine a collapse that will leave you living in
a Mad Max type scenario, but we aren't suggesting to rebuild
things back to the way they were and pack things up, saying
Mission Accomplished.  Look how well that turned out for
George W. Bush?

We are looking ahead to what is possible, using known
science and the bleeding edge technology and base what we
are capable of building on that.

This is a moving target, most things that are true as I
write this today will be outdated or at least superceded by
new disoveries in a decade or less.  So this is why we are
building this in the way we are.  We are not providing an
instruction manual for building a future civilization, but a
toolkit that will constantly be improved and evolve as
things change, for generating successive iterative stages of
civilization with the goal of creating a stable multi-planet
post-scarcity civilization for Mankind that will be a place
that we will want our children's children to live in.

Is this aspirational?  In part, yes.  But it is an
experiement as a first step down a very long road to make a
better world for future generations.

So think of the Primer as a tool for building a genome for
generating a series of civilizations, that will improve with
each iteration, a framework to help us continue to progress,
steer us away from pitfalls and collapse scenarios.  If
there is a collapse, it will be there to help pick up the
pieces and start rebuilding the next day as quickly as
possible.

Our approach is a process not a plan, it is a generator that
can take a vision on one side, and build it on the other.

But a word of caution, this is a road for you to take, not a
destination that you will likely live to arrive at.  And
even if you do live to see it, there will be all sorts of
new problems and dangers and things that we will have
screwed up that will need to be fixed that we can't even
imagine today.  But you have to start somewhere and this is
where we have chosen to start.

** Primer

Every Primer should begin with an origin story -- not all
Primers will cover as large a canvas as all of civilization,
so scale your LOD to the scope of what your Primer will cover.

** Origin Story
  - Filters

  - 1. The Big Bang
  - 2. Stars Light Up
  - 3. New Chemical Elements
  - 4. Earth and the Solar System

  - Life
  - 5. Life on Earth
  - 6. Collective Learning
  - 7. Agricuture
  - 8. The Modern Revolution

The origin story is the first part of the primer,[fn:1]
followed by the theses (declarations), then education (triv,
quad, laurea etc), then the shops and guilds, then the
value-chain, then bioregions, and finally production.

Man started out just as any other animal on the savannah,
but development of tools, then speech and finally writing
resulted in an estrangement that in our minds that estranged
us from the world and who we were that seemed to have
started with Aristotle and all of those god damned lists and
categories.  It wasn't until the Copernican Revolution which
showed that there was nothing special about where we were in
the universe that we began the slow process of decentering.
The Darwinian Revolution was the second decentering which
taught us that we are just one more creature in a vast
fabric of life and that all of the rules apply to all of us,
we are no exception. I believe that we are at the brink of a
third which will teach us that our minds and our
intelligence is nothing special either.  We've fallen a long
way and we are still falling.  And as anyone who has jumped
out of an airplane could tell you, the fall is nothing to be
afraid of, it's when the ground breaks your fall that you
have to worry about. Intelligence is all around us, we are
simply too caught up in ourselves to notice.  I hope that
when Man does hit bottom that it will leave us humbled and
capable of living within the limits of the ecosystems that
we are part of.  That doesn't mean we will stop hacking them
and shaping them for our own purposes, but it will have to
be with an understanding that we either find a way of living
within the carrying capacity of where we live, or we die.
You can not increase carrying capacity by using up or
abusing resources faster than they can be replaced.  If you
can hack nature to increase sustainible carrying capacity
great -- but that is not what Man is doing now.

** Footnotes

[fn:1] What about language?  Origins lays out our history which is
tells what our metaphysics and physics.  The nuts and bolts of laguage
will be in the Triv.  but I'm talking about something deeper, more
structural -- language both spoken, written and executable -- a
language of the long now that will change far slower than language at
the upper pace layers -- it will change, but over centuries and
milennia not years and decades.  It should be something that is stable
for long periods of time.  Different pace-layers will have different
versions of it, the fashion layer tries out new ideas which are
filtered and refined until they change the lowest layers.
