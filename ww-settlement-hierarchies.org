#+begin_quote
In this example, an isolated building is at the lowest
point, and the ecumenopolis is at the top with the greatest
number of people:

(Note: This settlement hierarchy is adapted from the work of
Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis for the actual current world
situation as of 2010 as opposed to Doxiadis' idealized
settlement hierarchy for the year 2100 that he outlined in
his 1968 book Ekistics.)

** CA Doxiadis

#+begin_quote
Doxiadis believed that the conclusion from biological and
social experience was clear: to avoid chaos we must organize
our system of life from Anthropos (individual) to
Ecumenopolis (global city) in hierarchical levels,
represented by human settlements. So he articulated a
general hierarchical scale with fifteen levels of Ekistic
Units:

Names of Units and Population Scale (final version, from
C.A.Doxiadis' last book, ACTION for Human Settlements,
p. 186, Athens Center of Ekistics, 1976): Note: The
population figures below are for Doxiadis' ideal future
ekistic units for the year 2100 at which time he estimated
(in 1968) that Earth would achieve zero population growth at
a population of 50,000,000,000 with human civilization being
powered by fusion energy.
