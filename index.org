 - [[./ww-intro.org][Introduction]]
 - 0.  [[./ww-ab-initio.org][Ab initio]]             -> First Principles
 - 1.  [[./ww-principles.org][Principles]]
   - Scientific Method
     - observe, record, repeat, and understand 
   - Enlightenment -- rationality and human centered
   - progress is not growth
   - transactional man
   - slaves create surpluses
   - lots of copies keep stuff safe
   - diversity: biological (genetic) and societal
     (specialties) determine if a
     system is anti-fragile or not.  
   - the larger the ecosystem the more diversity is
     possible -- this explains why civilization is now
     global, because complexity needs ever larger
     petri-dish -- that must become the solar
     system. Tainter argues that civilizations hit maximum
     complexity and can't sustain itself -- but this is
     because the civ has maxed out it's ability to
     innovate and change the parameters of the petri dish
 - 2.  [[./ww.points-of-view.org][Three Points of View]]
   - Point of View
   - Level of Detail (LOD)   -> scale
   - Rate of Change (ROC)    -> velocity and direction
   - Process of Change (POC) -> as a system
 - 3.  Dualities
   - Part-Whole
   - Map-Territory
   - Meta-Data
 - 4.  Structures
   - arrays?
   - atoms       -> symbol, string, integer
   - ????        -> k-v, triple
   - rhizomes    -> graphs
   - sets        -> lists: bag, seq, alt
   - trees       -> branching lists
   - layers      ->
 - 5.  Generators
   Most generators generate random crap and chaos, but a
   few, created all of the structure that we see in the
   universe and here on earth, a handful of generators
   created life, and a handful of other generators built
   civilization.
   - cellular autonoma
   - DNA/RNA
   - generative grammers
   - lisp macros -> code that generates code
   - generative processes
 - 6.  Boundries
   - sensual
   - cognitive: limits & bias
   - memory
   - biological-environmental
 - 7.  Estrangement          -> beauty and connectedness
   - balance between being a whole, or a part of a whole, 
     a leaf on a stream, or a boat navigating a river
   - everything applies to all things in the same way
   - free will is limited, but not deterministic
   - consciousness is an illusion
   - control -- fear is about uncertainty and powerlessness
   - quality and care       -> intentionality and contribution
   - beauty and order, order is a set of relationships that
     reinforce each other and become larger than the sum of
     their parts.
   - care -- practice -- integrity
 - 8.  Patterns              ->
   - patterns and anti-patterns
   - patterns identify anti-fragile groups of relationships 
   - anti-patterns destroy life, beauty and connectedness
   - patterns are not designs
   - patterns are generative processes
 - 9.  Scaffolds You build a scaffold as a supporting structure for what
   you are building that will be taken away when it is
   finished and can stand on its own.  Our scaffolds is a
   generative structure that came from Steward Brand called
   the Pace-layer model for civilization.

   The APPL will have as it's introduction, the APPL
   pace-layer model -- not here.  Here we will only discuss
   pace-layers as a concept and how we will use the model as
   a foundational scaffold for APPL, Primer and Hoard.
 - 10. The Way (methodology) -> defined Top Down vs generative Bottom Up
   - small steps
   - learning to see what is there, rather than trying to
     impose what you want

   - finance
