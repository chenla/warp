** XX. Horcrux

The document manifests in many guises: as scroll, codex, web
page, or ebook.  But in every case its primacy is
unchallenged.  Documents reflect how our brains process
information, both as a linear narrative and a hierarchical
structure.

In all their manifestations a document is externalized shard
of the mind/s that created it.  And since a document can
exist outside of and independent of the mind, that part of
mind is imortal, so long as a copy exists.

The web as blured this understanding -- with
web-applications replacing web pages, or collections of
pages into web sites.

We need to reclaim the document and put it back where it
belongs, as a natural extension and externalization of mind,
which can gracefully degrade, be serialized in countless
encodings and recorded on countless types of physical media.

But documents are not simply extensions and externalizations
of memories, they allow us to offload and extend information
from working, medium term and long memory.  In this way,
documents are an extension and externalization of cognition.

Jupyter Notebooks and Org Babel make it possible to combine
both narrative text and running code in documents in what is
called literate computing.

---

We think of documents as immutable objects -- physical
media; a paper book, magazine or newspaper, a pdf or epub
file.  This is largely a good thing, because an immutable
object is an exact copy, it can be transported, transfered
to another person, locked up in a box etc.

But there are other things we could do with documents.  They
could be dynamic, as in =literate computing=, where code runs
in the document that can accept manual input or pull in live
streaming data from outside sources that dynamically update
the document.  We could then flip this so that code in the
document makes changes and runs things elsewhere as in
=literate DevOps=.

Last night I was reading a new term =GitOps= which uses push
and merge requests to trigger testing and deployment
pipelines as part of =continuous integration=.

We can also create hierarchical libraries of documents which
inherit properties from other documents.  A book can be
thought of in this way, if each chapter is considered to
also be a stand-alone document.

We do this using a CSS-like cascading model of inheritance,
where properties are set and inherited be those underneath
it in the hierarchy unless it is explicitly (and-or
conditionally) overridden locally.

This is an especially powerful model because you can take a
document and plug it into different hierarchies that provide
different contexts.  Say you have a personal context at your
desk that includes all of your notes, contacts, messages and
personal library of documents.  You then want to present it
at a meeting.  So you take the document to the meeting, plug
in the document into the meeting context and each person in
the meeting is able to see a group context, as well as plug
it into their personal context at the same time.  Each
person can then share context from their personl context and
it becomes part of the group context.

Now let's expand the concept of the reader.  We assume that
documents have human readers, but over the next few years AI
systems will read and interact with documents as well.  So
we need documents that can be both human understandable, as
hierarchical linear narratives that are made up of text,
binary images, tables of data and live code.  But at the
same time, the document is also represented as a Quad Store
(triples + provenance) which is machine understandable.

In this way, you AI personal assistant will not only respond
to commands, but understand and interactively collaborate
with documents.

So let's rethink the document as a stack:







** XX. Force

The threat of physical force underpins pretty much all of
nature.  Predation goes to the core of all ecosystems,
living things feed off of each other, with a base layer of
living things that purely transmute the elements, light and
heat into living matter.  Each layer of complexity feeds off
of the layer below it.

Human societies are ecoystems as well, with predation
becoming the norm as group size grows larger than human
scales are designed for.  Even when group sizes are not
exceeded intergroup violence becomes the norm when groups
become sedantary.  It would seem that the only scenario
where humans don't do violence to each other is when groups
are within human scales and groups are at least semi-nomadic
and are not competing with other groups for resources.

Modern societies are getting less violent, but again, only
when resources are available to meet everyone's physical,
material needs.  But, unlike our nomadic ancestors this is a
false peace, as all societies are ultimate built on a
foundation that can deliver physical force against members
in the group.  Currencies are backed up, ultimately, by
someone with a gun.

If we can return to a mode of living within human scales and
allows us to be semi-nomadic without the need to compete for
material resources, I believe that we could build a society
that minimizes the need for that threat backing everything
up.  I say minimize, because it's nearly inconceivable to
contemplate any society that didn't require physical force
as final resort.  We will never be rid of the gun, not
completely.  It will still still be there, even it, like the
garrison of PLA soldiers in Hong Kong, it is never seen.

But what bothers me more about force is how much of it is
need to establish new economies and societies.  This has
been keeping me awake nights.  In one respect it's obvious
-- money, and lots of it.  Money is backed by threat of
physical force and can buy a lot of it.  But that only works
so far.  I'm starting to get a fuzzy sense of how it might
be done, using a combination of nudging, money, and
co-opting existing institutions to provide that backing if
or when it is needed.  In corrupt societies (all societies
are corrupt, just to different degrees) if you build
something that is valuable it is almost certain that someone
will take notice and put a gun to your head and take it from
you, unless you have the backing of another corrupt entity
that has your back.  The trick is to build a network of such
reltionships in which is mututally benificial.  Perhaps you
can trade information for force.  Information is far more
flexible a tool than force, and those with force need that
flexiblility to maintain control of their domain.

** Polity
We outlined broad concepts and structures for governance now
we can put together an actual working polity -- the polity
in our case is both public and private.

We have to merge them together at appropriate scales.

Once we have polity worked out, then we have a foundation
for the three branches: middle, scope and culture.
** Middle

MIDDLE is infrastructure -- up till now we've had public
infrastructure and private infrastructure -- which we need
to merge into a commons

MIDDLE boils down to three things -- process management,
feedback loops and physical stuff -- assets

** Culture 

  Domus  -> unit of local organization
  Shop   -> unit of local organization 
  Polis  -> unit of regional organization

  CULTURE
  ARC

** Scope

:END:

** Arc

ARC is part of Culture, but is so big it deserves it's own
major grouping.
