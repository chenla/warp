   - 0. [[./ww-ab-initio.org][Ab initio]] -> First Principles
     - getting rid of the onion
       - Discard romanticism and her sister mysticism
       - Discard dogmatism, but don't throw away good ideas
         that happen to be part of discarded ideologies
       - as complicated as it needs to be -- not reductionism,
         which was the mistake that modernists made
  
    - 1. Principles
      - Scientific Method
        - observe, record, repeat, and understand 
      - Enlightenment -- rationality and human centered
      - progress is not growth
      - No Zero Day -- ab initio, not tabla rasa -- we build
        on what works and what has worked -- if it doesn't
        work then discard it, change the system to fit human
        nature, not human nature to fit a system.
      - Don't be hasty -- things take as long to change as
        they take.
      - Be relentless as well as patient.
      - The last to escape -- hope


  - 2. Three Points of View
    - Level of Detail (LOD)   -> scale
    - Rate of Change (ROC)    -> velocity and direction
    - Process of Change (POC) -> as a system

  - 3. Dualities
    - Part-Whole
    - Map-Territory
    - Metadata-Data

  - 4. Structures

  - 5. Boundries

  - 6. Estrangement          -> beauty and connectedness

  - 7. Patterns              ->

  - 8. The Way (methodology) -> defined Top Down vs generative Bottom Up
