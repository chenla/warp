** Scope

In Canto XVI we saw the overall structure of a civilization
level compiled primer with three branches that provide
negative feedback on each other.  But it's not just a matter
of adding money and people to build a civilization.  This is
not a template, it is a generate grammar.  This canto will
show how you get from an individual, or a group of indivuals
who which to found a community to scale up to a full blown
civilization.  W&W provides a number of initial default
parameters that can be used as placeholders until
circumstances and experience determines what those
parameters will need to be to work in a given context. We
will structure this using a succession stage model that
assumes that the civilization initially begin as a small,
sparse and widely scattered group of individuals and grow
and connect with each other until it becomes a distributed
global or solar civilization.

** TL;DR
