  - Contents
  - [[./intro.org][Introduction]]
  - Buildings
    - Generative Processes -> bottom up, not top down.
    - The Room as atomic unit
    - Pattern Languages based on culture and climate)
    - Shearing Layers

  - Settlements (urban planning)
    - Zones
      - not traditional urban zoning
      - based on how often a zone needs to be visited  
    - relationships between buildings
    - flow -> people, goods, services

    - Levels -> not sure about this, but designing
      settlements in both vertical and horizontal axis not
      simply buildings as having multiple floors but
      multi-story settlements in the way that forests are
      multistory.  Soleri was the pioneer in this, but I
      want to approach is ideas from a different
      perspective.  He talked of generative design, but his
      designs were very much top down.  I don't think he
      intended it this way -- his arcologies were not meant
      to be plans, but what mature generative multi-story
      settlements might look like.
