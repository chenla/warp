  - Contents
  - Introduction
  - Buildings
    - Generative Processes -> bottom up, not top down.
    - The Room as atomic unit
    - Pattern Languages based on culture and climate)
    - Shearing Layers

  - Settlements (urban planning)
    - Zones
      - not traditional urban zoning
      - based on how often a zone needs to be visited  
    - relationships between buildings
    - flow -> people, goods, services

    - Levels -> not sure about this, but designing
      settlements in both vertical and horizontal axis not
      simply buildings as having multiple floors but
      multi-story settlements in the way that forests are
      multistory.  Soleri was the pioneer in this, but I
      want to approach is ideas from a different
      perspective.  He talked of generative design, but his
      designs were very much top down.  I don't think he
      intended it this way -- his arcologies were not meant
      to be plans, but what mature generative multi-story
      settlements might look like.

** TL;DR

The Structures section has been cleaned out and is no longer
about data and social structures.  That material has been
moved to their respetive sections.

The section is no devoted to physical structures -- buildings.
