** Scope
** TL;DR

Citizen Polis & Citizen Domus

Polis as center of a nomes -- bioregion

Domus is legal and physical, member/citizen of a domus has
equity in that domus, and if they leave a domus, they can
transfer that equity (buy in) to another domus.  Each domus
belongs to at least one polis and the polis provides
infrastruture for the nomes.

Citizenship includes a social contract with any polis or
domus they belong to.

Children are wards of a domus until they come of age at 11,
after which they are citizens, but not yet participating
citizens, and at a later age 16-18 they become fully vetted
voting citizens.

----

In societies where familes as base units have undergone a
relentless fragmentation -- from band, to extended family,
to nuclear family, to individual, to a splintered collection
of roles that each individual is made up.  All humans, from
the beginnings of our species began at least when Sapiens
split off as a distinct subspecies.  It's quite plausible
tht other subspecies such as Cro-Magnon and Neandrathal
shared this with us. That transactional man that is divided
into different specializations within a band (or pack)
created different roles and individuals might hold multiple
roles at the same time and at different times in their
lives.

But our identity was centered on the unit of organization
that determined survival.  Membership of a band was the
defining concept of self because you could not survive
outside of the band.  Modern Man now has fractured as far as
we can fracture, with our roles becoming increasingly
distributed.

Our concept of citizenship needs to adapt to this reality,
and the idea of citizenship being based soley on membership
in the nation-state which in most cases in which you were
born is no longer flexible enough for the complex social
fabrics that we belong to.

I suggest that the concept of citizenship needs to change to
reflect this.

There is a distinction between citizen and member.  A member
belongs to a group, and shares the privileges and
obligations of that group.  But a citizen has equity, and
shares in the liabilities of the group as well.  In this
way, citizenship is a legal concept of membership, whereas
membership is a far more loose and less enforced concept.

Citizenship requires that members not only be liable but
accountable to the group and this is done through legibility.

We propose to move the concept of citizen to being a citizen
of a polis, and a citizen of a domus.

This does not preclude citizenship in traditional
nation-states, and for the forseeable future this will be
unavoidable for practically everyone.


   - ancient greek sense of citizen of a polis which was
     defined as a means of distinguishing citizens from
     slaves.

#+begin_quote
It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made
Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After
all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore
might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks
fought together, they fought in order to avoid being
enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who
might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their
political institutions so as to remain free men.

— Geoffrey Hosking, 2005

#+begin_quote
From Lat. civix ‘citizen’, civilis ‘civil, pertaining to
city’, civitas ‘civil community, city’. The Early Antiquity
is an epoch which distinguished between ‘citizens’ and
‘non-citizens’ or, according to Aristotle, ‘freemen’ and
‘slaves by nature’.

   - define more as obligation to the group, than rights
     bestowed on members of that group.
   - citizenship and self-identity as member of a nation
   - enity model?  cascade?
   - overlaping ?

   - private and public
   - citizens are not simply members of a group


   - define citizen -> broadly, anything with self agency
     that is part of the system that is entitled to rights,
     benifits and obligations.  This is broader than humans,
     we need to include a wide range of the cognitive specturm.
   - what you get & what you give

   - the family unit
   - inheritance
 
   - rights
     - basic income a little below happiness threshold
   - obligations
