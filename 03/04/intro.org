A pattern is an expression that is meant to be manifested in
a hoard as something that is physical object, or as a
process, a rule that is a mechanism that takes input, which
is matched against hardcoded constants, or variables that
have set parameters.

The age that a child begins school is a variable that is
determined by human developmental and congnitive limits
which are constants.

The height of the riser in a stair is determined by the
average height of people in a given era, as well as other
variables such as gravity -- perhaps stairs on the moon or
on mars will require different height risers in stairs...

The length of time to hatch an egg can't be mucked with --
for a chicken it's 21 days for an Emu it's 43-50 days.

SEE: http://farmingfriends.com/incubation-periods-for-different-species-of-birds-eggs/

For humans, it varies but can be mucked with a bit, as
infants can be placed in incubators if they are born before
they come to term.

Patterns are generative in nature -- in the case of a
process, they literally will generate something.  In the
case of made things when a pattern is manifest it is greater
than the sum of its parts

What are pattern languages -- how they work, how to make
them, how to use them.

Need a chapter on what patterns are NOT.  Many of the
pattern languages and there are a lot of them, do not seem
to understand that patterns are not simply another
methodology you use in software or construction projects,
they are meant to reveal sets of complex relationships which
defy description.  They work on a nonverbal level as much as
the verbal, they are not classification systems.  Patterns
are only useful if those patterns have been woven into your
brain, you have to master them through conscious practice,
experiment and contemplation.  If you don't they are just
another checklist of attributes or features to add to a
design or project.  Patterns are not snap together modular
Lego Bricks.  When they have been used that way people
wonder why they don't work.
