** TL;DR

Scaffold as a supporting structure for what you are building
that will be taken away when it is finished and can stand on
its own.  Our scaffolds is a generative structure that came
from Steward Brand called the Pace-layer model for
civilization.

The APPL will have as it's introduction, the APPL pace-layer
model -- not here.  Here we will only discuss pace-layers as
a concept and how we will use the model as a foundational
scaffold for APPL, Primer and Hoard.
