HARD
  - fuel -> chemical and electrical
  - flow -> electrical -- though I suppose gas cold be treated as a
    flow
  - measured -> in joules and watts
  - mechanisms
    - kenetic   -> muscle, wind, water, sunlight
    - potential -> stored

    - direct    -> muscle, mechanical (turning a shaft)
    - muscle, wind, water, sunlight, 
    - indirect heat-to-steam-to-piston, internal combustion - heat-to-piston  
    - sunlight converted into sugars
    - sunlight converted into electricity
    - atoms split or fused -> heat -> electricity
WET
  - fuel -> food
  - flow -> oxygen
  - measured in calories 

SOFT
  - measured in watt/hours

** TL;DR

Talk in terms of energy as a fuel, a descrete substance, and flow, a
substance that

If we want to better understand how we speculate about
future energy now, then we need to appreciate the extent to
which those speculations have a history, and that their
history (from the early Victorian period on) contains such
fictions as Heinlein’s story as often as, and frequently
mixed in with, highly technical debates about the
characteristics and requirements of different modes of
energy production and consumption.
