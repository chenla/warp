** TL;DR

Talk in terms of energy as a fuel, a descrete substance, and flow, a
substance that 


#+begin_quote
If we want to better understand how we speculate about
future energy now, then we need to appreciate the extent to
which those speculations have a history, and that their
history (from the early Victorian period on) contains such
fictions as Heinlein’s story as often as, and frequently
mixed in with, highly technical debates about the
characteristics and requirements of different modes of
energy production and consumption.

** Table of Contents

HARD
  - fuel -> chemical and electrical
  - flow -> electrical -- though I suppose gas cold be treated as a
    flow
  - measured -> in joules and watts
  - mechanisms
    - kenetic   -> muscle, wind, water, sunlight
    - potential -> stored

    - direct    -> muscle, mechanical (turning a shaft)
    - muscle, wind, water, sunlight, 
    - indirect heat-to-steam-to-piston, internal combustion - heat-to-piston  
    - sunlight converted into sugars
    - sunlight converted into electricity
    - atoms split or fused -> heat -> electricity

WET
  - fuel -> food
  - flow -> oxygen
  - measured in calories 

SOFT
  - measured in watt/hours
