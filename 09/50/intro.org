** Scope
** TL;DR

What I'm trying to get at here is a build very simple toy
model for learning that we can build a system around.

How do we learn?  For that matter what is learning in the
first place?  Acquiring new knowledge, behaviors, skills etc
is just not going to cut it.

What does it mean to aquire new knowledge?  It's not just
recording information into memory, like adding a file to a
file system in a storage device.  The device doesn't /know/
what is stored, it is just a bunch of bits that are
organized into a hierarchical file system of files and
directories. Each file has a pointer to somewhere in the tree.

Memory is not learning, but it is part of it.  A memory is a
variety of different bit sensory data that has been
processed through a hierarchy of pattern matchers which link
different things together.

The more time that you are exposed to similar things, the
more /familiar/ it becomes.  You build up a composite mental
image of something by repeated exposure -- the more times,
the more detailed the model and the more links to other
patterns and memories -- it is then that you can say you
have learned something, that it has become knowledge.

You can know /about/ something and you can /know/ something
-- that your model is strong enough to give you confidence
that you understand the thing.  That doesn't mean you are
right or that what you know is even real, in fact learning
is not about truth, or reality or lies and delusions.  It's
just a mental model that has enough connections to
constitute knowledge.

If pattern matchers see the same pattern long enough then
they constitute a an abstract concept 

When you go about learning something, it doesn't matter
what, from making your bed, to building a pagoda you do it
by observing through experimentation or a demonstration of
what is to be learned.

Then you try to duplicate it.  This is very complex and
requires different parts of the brain, from the limbic
system telling you to fear beign burnt when dealing with
fire, to the muscle memory of your placing your fingers on
the fret board of a ukulele.  This allows your concsious
mind to hand off different kinds of memories and
knowledge to different parts of your brain.  This frees up
cognitive resources to do complex things.

We are not consciously aware of most of the lower level
pattern matchers but only the 'final' conclusion of the
hierarchy in giving a confidence that you know what you are
looking at.

So when we teach people, we provide them with multiple
exposures, which might only require a few repitition or tens
of thousands of repititions to master something very
complex.

The number of repititions required depend on how many
different connections you can make to what is being learned.
So if you teach someone something, you should teach the same
thing from slightly different perspectives and contexts with
each repitition.  So, multiple exposure, with each exposure
incrementally different from the last exposure in order to
establish a wider variety information to connect to
different memories and pattern recognizers in your brain.

We have a good idea not only how we remember things, but
also how we forget.  Spaced repitition is a technique for
reinforcing memory just before we forget it.

So we need multiple repititions, spaced correctly with each
repetition slightly different from the last.


Life-long learning must be woven into the fabric and
workflow of our day to day lives -- so our externalized
cognitive infrastructure must keep track of what we know and
what we don't know and expose us to things we need to
remember at just the right time. This applies to individuals
as well as to groups.

** Chalkhall & Saltmine

Thinking back to Engelbart's concept of the integrated
information for a knowledge worker -- it's no enough.  We
need to integrate goal seeking both in terms of tasks but
also short and long term goals in terms of processes broken
into steps.  We then need to create a system that knows what
you know, and when you are about to forget it and weave the
reinforcement into the daily workslow.  You can then set
learning goals which are then treated as another kind of
project.  And projects are treated as just another kind of
learning goal.

Your hoard is made up of:

  - what you intentionally keep
  - new information coming in
    - general info -- news
    - what you intentionally look for and read/watch/listen
    - messages sent to you -- intentional
  - reaction to that information
    - save, delete, label
    - notes, annotations, links
    - messages in response -- phone calls, sms, email
  - conversations - discourse
    - real time conversations
    - delayed conversations
    - long term conversations -> over a lifetime or
      generations
  - works -> things that you compose or edit
    - journals
    - essays
    - long form books
    - drawings
    - hand written notes and notebooks (non digital formats)
    - bitmap and vector graphics
    - video and audio recordings
  - data -- logs that keep track of what you did, where and
    when you did it.  So when you save a bookmark there
    should be a lot of other surrounding context saved along
    with it.  This is the data that we are scared that
    facebook and google have on us, and which we as
    individuals need to leverage for ourselves and obfuscate
    what outsiders are able to collect.  So we need to learn
    to spy on ourselves and learn how to leverage the
    information collected to understand the world around us
    and to get stuff done.

This all becomes a graph, with each thing in the data store
linked to other things.  But this is not just a dumb
filesystem with additional links -- we need subsystems which
are also trying to make connections as well -- so we have
the composed, /intentional graph/, and the /augmented graph/

We can then leverage that data to transform our workflow and
augment and externalize our intelligence.

For example, if we use a typing break app to deal with RSI
then we can integrate that with a spaced repitition to use
those breaks to read something, watch a video that our
primer has scheduled to reinforce something you are learning
or researching.

The idea of a feed is not necessarily bad -- so long as it
isn't being set us as slot machine to generate ad revenue
for another company.

But the feed must be designed not to suck you in, but to
help you explore --> a news item should then have side links
to see the same news from a different POV.  If something in
an article or story allows you to change direction from
taking in information, to actively seeking it, or tagging it
or capturing it or taking action.


  

** Foci

Focus provides different types of context for reinforcing
memory -- you don't just show the same flashcard over and
over, you show the same information in different contexts
each time.

  - introduction -> for new information 
  - mastery      -> deliberate interactive practice
  - depth        -> learning more about something from
                    different POVs 
  - awe          -> reinforce connections and bigger concept 
  - reference    -> look-up, detailed & comprehensive 

** Notes

Great Hall, Chalk Hall, Study Hall, Karel

Great hall -- one off, collective then disband 
Chalk Hall -- group lecture and discourse 
Study hall -- social setting for study, coffee shop, at set times and place
Karel.        -- otium, private study, practice and contemplation

Threads 

personal rss for spaced repetition one unit has three videos and three different texts

Mediums. Stone, chalk, ink, pixel 

Three succession stages 
Three cognitive stages
Three levels of difficulty
Three video and three text repetitions , with different Foci, LOD and POV

Five foci -- intro, mastery, depth, awe, reference

Pattern, concept, tool, place, person, event, technique, recipe, keystone ( ), parameter, rule, story, quote

Rule is broad, from moore's law, to grammar rule, to algorithm
