** Epigraph

“Many a long dispute among divines may be thus abridged: It
is so; it is not so; it is so; it is not so.”

 — Ben Franklin

#+begin_quote
It's all a question of story.  We are in trouble just now
because we do not have a good story.  We are in between
stories.  The Old Story -- the account of how the world came
to be and how we fit into is -- is not functioning properly,
and we have not learned the New Story.  The Old Story
sustaied us for a long time.  It shaped our emotional
attitudes, provided us with life purpose, energized action.
It consecrated suffering, integrated knowledge, guided
education.  We awoke in the morning and knew who we were.
We could identify crime and punish criminals.  Everything
was taken care of because the story was there.  It did not
make men good; it did not take away the pains and
stupidities of life, or make for unfailing warmth in human
association.  But it did provide a context in which life
could function in a meaningful manner.

— Thomas Berry, "The New Story" (1973)

#+begin_quote
[B]y the late twentieth century, science essentially
confirmed their assertion of the non-individuated permanence
of all phenomena.  I don’t think any adjective can
adequately capture the profundity of such an achievement. We
have placed ourselves at the heart of the universal
narrative. Such awareness clearly goes well beyond “just the
facts.” We find that the universe is not just something “out
there” that we may know about intellectually... but that it
is what we are actually part and parcel of.

— Neal Wolfe, The Case for Awe (2015)

** TL;DR

All is preface, but in the case of orgin stories it is
really true -- an origin story is an expanded cultural
mythos, a shared story that provides a foundation for
communication, social cooperation, it is a cultural map and
encylopedia, and the foundation for spoken and written
languages.


*** Start from where you are, now rewind

Rather than jumping straight in to our primary goal of
understanding cultural human origin stories, let's start not
with mythological origin stories but the more recent idea of
origin story as a back-story revealing how a character,
often a superhero or group of people become a protagonist or
antagonist in a narratives and especially in series of
stories that might be in comic books, like Spiderman, a
series of novels such as the Sherlock Holmes series, a
television series like Star Trek or the Harry Potter book
and film series.
