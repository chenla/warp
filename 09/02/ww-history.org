** What is History?

History is literally what was said, or written.  We now have
discovered a wide range of ways that the universe has written it's own
history if we take the time to learn to read it.

      directly.
  6.  Secondary sources or Indirect sources provides information indirectly.
  7.  TERTIARY sources are used to describe a work which is a
      compilation of primary and secondary sources.It focused on the
      identification of scholarly work than on content.for
      example:bibliography,library catalog,directories etc.
  8.  That is why RANKE said”NO SOURCES,NO HISTORY”.
  9.  To Ranke “all kinds of sources should be subjected to criticism.
  10. HEURISTICS means searching of facts or sources.
  11. HERMENEUTICS aims to find out the authenticity or veracity of

...."I am fully aware that, if anyone took the trouble to
peruse some of the things I wrote before, during, and after
the war, he would have no difficulty at all in convicting me
of contradictions and inconsistencies at least as glaring as
any I have detected in others. Indeed, I am not sure that I
should envy any historian who could honestly claim to have
lived through the earth-shaking events of the past fifty
years without some radical modifications of his outlook. My
purpose is merely to show how closely the work of the
historian mirrors the society in which he works. It is not
merely the events that are in flux. The historian himself is
in flux. When you take up a historical work, it is not
enough to look for the author's name on the title page: look
also for the date of publication or writing--it is sometimes
even more revealing. If the philosopher is right in telling
us that we cannot step into the same river twice, it is
perhaps equally true, and for the same reason, that two
books cannot be written by the same historian."

** History, A Definition by Charles Olson

#+begin_quote
Like it or not, see it or not, history is the /function/ of any one of
us.
   
It is in this sense that, today, one has to regard history not at
all as (1) events of the past, (2) as a "fate" (Mussolini crying,
when the troops hit Anzio, "History has got us by the throat") or (3)
thatwe are making it, that horrible fallacy of the present which spews
itself out of all radios newspapers magazones outh, as though it was a
damn fire-spitting dragon.

It is literally a function that one can take it quietly and usefully.

How to say it, so that it is abundently clear.  It isn't at all unlike
Keats' proposition that a man's life (he was speaking of Shakespeare
and his plays) is an allegory.  It is that one does have a life to
live, exactly that much.  And that because it is that much and it is
one's own, it has scale.  That is, it isn't more of the same, or so
much "humanity" and all that, any of the counters not now offered
(which lead on the other side instantly by hypostasizings.
Dishminishments and hypostatasizings, about what we have offered us.

'Story, Be cocknet. Drop the H — how often, if you are a writer, you
have been told by everyone you meet, if you could take my life down,
that would be a story.

<----------------------big indent-------------------> (Only thus, by
the way, can one say mortal — not as a "lifetime," not as flesh going
toward death and resurrection, but as /history/: that you live.  An
active.  The dynamic is, not the energy exploded, wasted, used,
whatever is done with it.  But tht is is there, to be used.

Let me try it this way: that a life is the historical function of the
individual.  History is the intensity of the life process —its /life
value/.  By this I do not mean to imply any imparted value, whether
moral, aesthetic or intellectual; the life value is simply conditioned
by its /determining/ power, which is manifested in definite historical
operations ("effects").  And of course, taking it this way, I do not
at all mean that history is a /force/ (the most wicked present fallacy
of all, which is leaving everybody about where Justice Holmes said it
for ever when he said the irresistible is usually only that which
hasn't been resisted).  The failure, indeed, to recognize that there
is such a thing as aaan historical function in any one of us, and
instead, to misunderstand the thing as a force instead, is to be as
wicked here on the human thing as to exploit the sun's power to
destroy man and his earth.  I do not hypostasize the concept of
history but employ it as a concept denoting intensity or value.  The
question as to whether or not a specific historical force exists has
nothing to do with this concept of history.

Frequently I employ the expression history promiscuouslly with life.
That's my point.  A function is how a thing acts.  There is a natural
proper or characteristic action of anything.  That is its function.
As of a human life I say it is its history.  It is the how.  There can
be no other.  But there must be this one.  It is.  The point is, to
drag it out.  There it is.  That's — history.

** The Chronometric Revolution

#+begin_quote
"These newly readable texts are encoded in DNA, in the half-lives of
 the radioisotopes of certain atoms, in the time-layered sediments in
 rocks, and in events occurring all across the cosmos that we can
 observe with powerful, space-based telescopes.".
