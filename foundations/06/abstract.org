** Scope

The problem is that since the development of spoken written
languages Sapiens have become increasingly estranged from the
world in which they belong.  This estrangement is a rift
which since 1800 is widening into a a canyon and threatens
to become a continental divide if we can not find a way of
healing this estrangement and creating societies and
buildings and modes of living in which we can feel
cormfortable and at home in again.  This is the foundation
work which will be the most difficult to do, but everything
depends on us getting this right.  And if we can get this
right, and mend the rift a lot of other things will fall
into place.

** TL;DR
