These competencies are underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative
regulations. That means:

   1. A rigid division of labor is in place for the purpose of
      performing regular daily tasks as official duties in the
      functioning of the bureaucratically governed system.
   2. In order to fulfill these duties the necessary chains of command
      are firmly established and divided up [among the Beamte], and
      their capacity to coerce (physical, sacred, or other) is firmly
      restricted by regulation.
   3. Regular and continuous fulfillment of these assigned duties, and
      the execution of respective rights is systematically secured by
      hiring people with certified qualifications.

These three aspects constitute the essence of bureaucratic
administration of a Behörde in the public sector. In the private
sector, these three aspects constitute the essence of a bureaucratic
management of a private company [Betrieb]. Not until the emergence of
the modern state could this type of bureaucratic government Behörde be
fully realized in political and church organizations. And it was not
until the development of the most advanced forms of capitalism that
this kind of administration emerged in the private sector.

** Toffler Quotes

#+begin_quote
For we are witnessing not the triumph, but the breakdown of
bureaucracy. We are, in fact, witnessing the arrival of a new
organizational system that will increasingly challenge, and ultimately
supplant bureaucracy. This is the organization of the future. I call
it "Ad-hocracy."

Man will encounter plenty of difficulty in adapting to this new style
organization. But instead of being trapped in some unchanging,
personality-smashing niche, man will find himself liberated, a
stranger in a new free-form world of kinetic organizations. In this
alien landscape, his position will be constantly changing, fluid, and
varied. And his organizational ties, like his ties with things, places
and people, will turn over at a frenetic and ever- accelerating rate.

First, in this particular system of organization, the
individual has traditionally occupied a sharply defined slot
in a division of labor. Second, he fit into a vertical
hierarchy, a chain of command running from the boss down to
the lowliest menial. Third, his organizational
relationships, as Weber emphasized, tended toward
permanence.

Each individual, therefore, filled a precisely positioned
slot, a fixed position in a more or less fixed
environment. He knew exactly where his department ended and
the next began; the lines between organizations and their
sub-structures were anchored firmly in place. In joining an
organization, the individual accepted a set of fixed
obligations in return for a specified set of rewards. These
obligations and rewards remained the same over relatively
long spans of time. The individual thus stepped into a
comparatively permanent web of relationships—not merely with
other people (who also tended to remain in their slots for a
long time)—but with the organizational framework, the
structure, itself.

Some of these structures are more durable than others. The
Catholic Church is a steel frame that has lasted for 2000
years, with some of its internal sub-structures virtually
unchanged for centuries at a time. In contrast, the Nazi
Party of Germany managed to bathe Europe in blood, yet it
existed as a formal organization for less than a quarter of
a century.  In turn, just as organizations endure for longer
or shorter periods, so, too, does an individual's
relationship with any specific organizational
structure. Thus man's tie to a particular department,
division, political party, regiment, club, or other such
unit has a beginning and an end in time. The same is true of
his membership in informal organizations—cliques, factions,
coffee-break groups and the like. His tie begins when he
assumes the obligations of membership by joining or being
conscripted into an organization.  His tie ends when he
quits or is discharged from it—or when the organization,
itself, ceases to be.
