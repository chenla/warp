Unlike process, a narrative POV views things as continuum of snapshots
of different states of the present.  Each snapshot becomes a point in
time where the state is frozen.  When you move forward or backward in
time you move to previous or future frozen states.  When understood
this way, the whole idea of time as a place doesn't work very well.

Entropy gives time a direction, it is a one-way process -- you can't
unstir a cup of coffee.

This is where we get the illusion of time as a lie -- we think in
terms of a present relative to a past, an illusion created my memories
of when the present was not the same as it is now.

Narratives are an effective means of modeling the world where there
are memories of things that are no longer the same as in the present.

Narratives move in a single direction, from past to present and from
present to future.  You can zoom in and out of narratives to see more
or less LOD, and narratives can be sped up or slowed down at different
rates than the events are happening in the narrative by zooming in and
out to provide more temporal LOD.

Now -- what about non-linear narritives -- aka arthurian prose cycles.
these are branching narratives, rhizomatic structures, which are
essentially graphs -- and we need to think of narratives as a broader
set of structures than beginning middle end.

That might be right -- of the four POVs here we don't have a
graph-based POV -- narratives are stuck with entropic one way
processes but they don't have to be one damn thing after another they
don't have to be Ariadne's thread through the maze, they can encompass
the maze and the threads that weave through them.

Sapiens are story tellers -- but we are constant riffing on stories --
there is no one story, we always are looking at tweaking the story to
give different outcomes -- this goes to the core of how we understand
and model the world -- but today we have the printing press and
perfect copies of things that don't change.  in fact we can be
punished if we change things -- but that's not how things really are
or how things have been -- we are ALL story tellers we tell stories,
not just repeat other people's stories

that is what a narrative really is and this is key to understanding
narrative as a POV!
