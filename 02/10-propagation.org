Specifically causal propagation -- 

How is Causal Propagation a POV?  That's what we have to explain here.

Perhaps it is what has or hasn't changed in one place relative to what
has or hasn't changed in another.  So that from one POV in space in
time the observer sees X but on the other side of the galaxy at the
same time but different place the observer sees Y because change has
does not propagate at the same rate.

Propagation, like time is a one-way process.

Change is not instantaneous, it is tied to the physical laws of the
universe.  Change can only change as fast as those physical laws
allow.

Propagation is the speed that change moves through time and space.

  Light Cone

So the maximum ROC at relative scales is limited by the speed of
light.

The exception is quantum entanglement -- but at the moment this isn't
important unless we develop tech that leverages -- and
maintaining entanglement is the big challenge for quantum
computing to leave the laboratory.

Change is also relative to the distance between two things -- the
shorter the distence the faster things change between them -- at
microscopic and atomic scales this is very important.

As we will see in the Pace-Layer model, the maximum ROC (speed of
light) might be important at very large scales, but there are all
sorts of scales -- different things happen at different temporal
scales in a society -- there are processes that happen slower or
faster or even vary, changing at different rates at different times
depending on what is changing.
