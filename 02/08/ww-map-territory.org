The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet,
could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is
it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe',
I'd have been lying!

#+begin_quote
The expression first appeared in print in a paper that
Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in New Orleans,
Louisiana in 1931:[1] In Science and Sanity, Korzybski
acknowledges his debt to mathematician Eric Temple Bell,
whose epigram "the map is not the thing mapped" was
published in Numerology.[fn:1]

    A map is not the territory it represents, but, if
    correct, it has a similar structure to the territory,
    which accounts for its usefulness.

    — Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity (1933, p. 58)[fn:2]

One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The
way one describes a story, to oneself or the world, is by
telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a
dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the
territory. The most accurate map possible would be the
territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and
perfectly useless. The tale is the map that is the
territory.

#+begin_quote
In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and
the Cartographers Guild drew a Map of the Empire whose size
was that of the Empire, coinciding point for point with
it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the
Study of Cartography saw the vast Map to be Useless and
permitted it to decay and fray under the Sun and winters.

In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered
Ruins of the Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; and in
all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of
Geography.

#+begin_quote
The inventions of philosophy are no less fantastic than
those of art: Josiah Royce, in the first volume of his work
The World and the Individual (1899), has formulated the
following: 'Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of
England has been levelled off perfectly and that on it a
cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect;
there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how
minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has
there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should
contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the
map of the map, and so on to infinity.' Why does it disturb
us that the map be included in the map and the thousand and
one nights in the book of the Thousand and One Nights? Why
does it disturb us that Don Quixote be a reader of the
Quixote and Hamlet a spectator of Hamlet? I believe I have
found the reason: these inversions suggest that if the
characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators,
we, its readers or spectators, can be fictions.

— Jorge Luis Borges, Partial Enchantments of the Quixote (1964)

Even in theology, it could be asked if the concept of a
single all powerful God, an infinite being, is a map or
territory?

Can a territory be sentient?  Can sentience, and
intelligence be possible unless it can separate itself from
the larger world it exists in?  Lesser Gods in human
mythologies don't have this same problem, there are many of
them, and they are acting on the world, therefore they exist
separate from the world.  But an all knowing, all seeing,
god is only possible if it is as complete a map of the
territory as the territory and so, is pefectly useless
and powerless.

This same argument can be used when postulating a god-like
artificial intelligence, it places a very real barrier
between the universe any any beings who inhabit it.
