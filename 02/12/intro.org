When thinking of the present as process, you are in the moment --
there is no past or future -- the past and future are only real when
you have a surplus of time to think about them -- if you are being
chased by a bear, you aren't going to be thinking about where you are
going to eat lunch, you are too busy not becoming the bear's lunch.

But when thinking of systems we are looking at a process from a lower
LOD.

When we think about something like Moore's Law, we are looking at ROC
at a lower LOD.

We're not very good at thinking of the past as being in the present,
but it is -- the past is still with us, it's just decayed and
overwritten by other things --

the big bang is something that can be understood as one big present --
because light travels at a fixed speed, when we look at distant
objects we are looking at light that has taken a long time to get here
-- we are effectively looking at things that happened long in the past
-- but there is no way of seeing how they are now in the present --
and in the same way, the light from what we are doing now, will travel
through space at a set speed and might be seen by others in the
distant future -- but they will be seeing us as we are now, not as we
are when they see us.

  - ERP -- business processes
  - Education as lifelong process
