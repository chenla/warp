In philosophy a point of view (POV) is a "stated matter of
consideration", taken from an individual's perspective. In
this sense a POV is entirely subjective.  But a POV can also
be seen as something that at least theoretically is
objective.

In physics, and in particular, the Theory of Relativity,
everything is understood to what can be observed from a
particular time and place, or more specifically an /inertial
frame of reference/.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference

This is the point in time or space where the observer is
looking and everything that is observed is relative to that
position.  If something is close or far away, or fast or
slow all depends on if the observer is traveling at the same
speed and direction as what is being observed, which means
that from that POV both the observer and the observed are
stationary relative to each other.

New proofs would come much easier if there were a single
universal coordinate system that worked for every problem
and every configuration of space-time. But as Einstein
discovered during those fraught, wandering years, the
universe doesn’t admit any one privileged choice of
coordinates.

“It’s not just that we don’t have such a choice,” said
Weatherall. “It’s that one of the things we take Einstein to
have taught us is that it would be a mistake to expect there
to be such a choice.”

From wikipedia -- Propositional attitudes:

  The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed
  similarly to the concept of a propositional attitude. A
  propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental
  state held by an agent toward a proposition.  --
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(philosophy)

POVs are critical to the concept of a worldview.

A World View is a mental model of the world that establishes
cognitive orientation for where you are relative to the
world.  Worldviews are a mixture of memories of things
observed and experenced, assertations of what those things
are and mean, and conjecture that fill in the blanks in that
model.  If you are in a room that has a door that you have
never seen opened, you will include in your mental model the
conjecture that there is either a room leading to another
room or corrider in the building or that it is an outside
wall that will take you outside the building.  There is also
the possibility that it is a fake door that doesn't open or
lead to anywhere.  Worldviews are full of such conjectures
that are constantly being updated and expanded as more
information is added to the model.

The maker of the model is always at the center of the model
-- I am here and the rest of the universe radiates out from
where I am at any given moment.

This is the case for pretty much anything animal that has a
brain, as well as groups, an ant colony has a collective
worldview as much as a group of close friends, a department
in a company, a government, a church congregation or even a
religion that spans the globe.

Collective POVs are, by definition, limited to a specific
way of looking at something -- without this, communication
and cooperation is at best difficult and in many cases,
impossible.

When we make rules for a group to follow, those rules first
define the POV that all members choose to observe from.
Without this, agreeing on what is right or wrong, or even
what is true or false is not possible.

Different cultures are based in part on their relationship
that that culture has to the environment.  For someone
living in a cold climate with harsh winters and short
intense summers, they will have a very different view of
nature than someone who has grown up in a mild semi-tropical
climate where the ocean is calm, and the night pleasant and
the the length of the day and night seldom differs over the
year more than an hour or so.  These POVs shape not only how
you feel about nature, but how you design a house, what
kinds of clothes you wear, the kinds of food that you will
have access to and how you can cook it.  Before
refridgeration, it was, and still is common to overcook food
so that it can survive longer in the heat.  People from cold
countries or who have refridgerators don't undertand why
people in the tropics would cook a piece of meat until it
approached the toughness of shoe leather.  But this makes
perfect sense if you want to cook for many people who may
eat at different times of the day.  You need cooked food
that won't go bad in severe heat in a couple of hours or
overnight.
