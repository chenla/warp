Alvin Toffler's concept of ROC 

The concept of the Half-Life -- how long it takes for half of
something to change.

Linear growth, Steady Growth vs Exponential Growth

ROC is relative to the age of something -- time is experienced
relative to how long something is relative to how long your have
lived.  When I was a child, as many children in school do, life is
measured relative to when the next major holiday or vacation is.
Growing up in the United States in the 1970's, summer holidays lasted
from late May or early June to the Memorial Day federal holiday at the
beginning of September.  Those three months seemed to last a lifetime.
When school let out in June, it the start of the next school year
seemed impossibly distent in the future.  Now that I am in my
mid-fifties, three months can pass in seamingly a hearbeat if your
aren't paying attention.

  - Complexity and Rate of Change
  - Size of a Territory and Rate of Change
  - Size of a Population and Rate of Change
  - Distance/LOD and Rate of Change
  - Scientific knowledge and Rate of Change
  - Limits on human ability to change and Rate of Change, 
  - Pace-Layers -- different things change at different rates
  - Rates of change that the universe (cosmic expansion) institutions,
    language, culture, fashion.
  - Different parts of buildings change at different rates -- what
    Brand called shearing layers.
  - Will talk about Pace-layers in more detail in it Part XX.
