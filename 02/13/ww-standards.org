** TL;DR

** Data Structures

I suppose we can talk about narratives -- linear structures,
rhizomatic structures where everthing is connected to
everything, which I suppose is a graph, and then
hierarchical structures which are tress.

Humans think all three ways -- we think linearly as stories and
we think as paths snaking through rhizomatic structures

and I think this is how we need to put it:

  - complexity is best suited to rhizomatic structures
  - sets are lists for threads winding through those
    structures these are ideal for modeling deterministic
    processes. lists can be:
    - bag -- intentionally unordered -- the order is not significant.
    - seq -- ordered -- the order may be by time, number,
      alphabet, magnitude or class.
    - alt -- which is a branching list in which only a
      single item can be chosen -- this is taken from user
      interfaces but also multiple choice tests etc.
  - trees for creating hierarchies -- which are nature for
    pack animals -- trees are partial rhizomes that show a
    specific set of causal, command and control type
    structures.
