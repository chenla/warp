** TL;DR
** Table of Contents

Most generators generate random crap and chaos, but a few,
created all of the structure that we see in the universe and
here on earth, a handful of generators created life, and a
handful of other generators built civilization.

   - cellular autonoma
   - DNA/RNA
   - generative grammers
   - lisp macros -> code that generates code
   - generative processes


  - phase changes -- small changes that trigger systemic change.


The model in half-life that talks about grid -- randomly
drop grains of sand on different square, and set how many
grains a square can hold before it triggers a cascade that
sends grains into adjascent squares.

Generative grammers have to work something like that -- they
are processes and most importantly is that they can cascade
to generate more order -- to become antifragile.

---

where in w&w do we put fragility, resiliance and
antigragile?

          estrangement?

I think part will go there -- what are the things that make
something strong or beautiful

and then we put how to generate them here....

Or do we strip that out of estrangment and create it's own
section....
