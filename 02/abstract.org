** Scope
 - POV
 - Perspective
 - Observer
 - Context

We construct POVs by combining one or more of the /five
cardinal vantage points/ which establishes where an observer
is relative to what is being observed 

Each vantage point is a range used to manipulate the
perspective like a slider on a sound mixing board that
changes the level of the vantage point.

This provides us with a cognitive tool box to help us
/think outside the box/, as well as to capture or model the
surrounding context of something as seen from different POVs.

This also helps to be aware of when we are mapping one POV
onto something in the past, for example, that existed in a
context quite different from today

ROC for example is useful to understand how buildings can be
thought of as made up of shearing layers -- and that
different parts of buildings change at different rates, or
as a different way of of looking at Big History other than
from a linear timeline divided into complexity thresholds.
The Big Bang is not something that happened in the past, it
is a process that is still going on today, or how change
propagates at different speeds in different places --
Gibon's famous "the future is already here, it's just not
evenly distributed".

These are not abstract, academic distinctions, they apply to
every part of our lives, the societies we live in.  They can
be used in education, in design, in production, commerce and
governanace.  These are tools that law enforcement officer
can use when evaluating a domestic dispute as well as to
piece together what had happened at a crime scene.

Ideally we want to encode our toolbox into machine
understandable and executible code.

----

It's important that we explain these concepts as tools for
building civilization -- so we need to show not only how
these tools work, but how to use them.


** TL;DR

[2018-05-22 Tue 09:52] This might be a good place to
consider why we need all this mishegoss.  Most of us reading
this will have grown up in a middle class background with a
standard liberal education that makes many assumptions about
how we see the world as being universal or even desirable.

I hope to establish a new paradigm that replaces the
assumptions that have been imposed on us by the evololution
of state legibility and high modernism which in practice
simplifies complexity down to a map showing a handfel of
parameters, axis and scale.  We forget that there is a very
real distinction between local and synoptic knowledge.  The
laster is by definition has less detail, less knowledge in
it because it needs to take something that can't load into
our heads because they exceed human cognitive and memory
limits.  The bigger the territory you try to fit in your
head the lower the LOD, the lower the LOD the more lossy it
becomes.

The modern world is becomming increasingly complex, but we
can't handle all of that complexity so we create ever more
simplfied maps to get around that only makes this worse.

The tools we use to understand the world are far too
simplisitic to be of much use any longer -- we need broader
range of tools to make sense of the world.  The problem with
this is that simplicity is "user friendly" and fast.
Complexity has a steep learning curve and slows us down.  We
trade speed and easy for depth, malleability, wisdom and
familiarity and efficiency.  Let's consider the last two,
familiarity and efficiency because that is the biggest thing
we loose when we spend most of our time in a epistimic,
synoptic contex.

It's long been understood that small farms are far more
productive hectare for hectare than large farms.  This is
because a small farm is familiar to the farmer, it is at a
scale small enough to fit in his head, Bill Mollison said
that he is often asked how large a farm should be, and his
answer was always "as large as you can handle".  You can
only handle what you can fit in your head, and in a farm
there is a lot to fit in.  Something becomes familiar when
it has been encountered so many times that it becomes
something like muscle memory, your brain understands and and
use that massive nexus of links to all the times that you
have encountered it so that it can be accessed sub
consciously.  We all use this in one form or another.  If
you commute to work every day, or go to the same market at
the same time every day, when waking or driving at the time
and you become distracted or lost in thought, you will
suddenly realize that you have gone to that place or at
least started to go there automatically, even if you
intended to go somewhere else.  Familiarity allows us to go
on autopilot so we can concentrate conscious efforts on
other things.  This is the goal of Mastery of anything, to
become so familiar with something that you can don't need to
pay attention to the larger sequence so that you can notice
and control the small details that a beginner can not see or
control because they need to pay attention to to things that
are familiar to the master.  In a small farm, the farmer
intimately knows the local climate, where the wind blows
from in the winter or summer.  Knows all of the plants and
animals both domestic and wild on the farm, their
charateristics their behaviors and how they compliment each
other.  The farmer knows the soil, and what plants need to
be grown to replace nitrogen, or which plants act to repell
insects which each the crops that can be sold.  The list is
almost endless, the tools, techniques that have worked and
which ones don't work, the countless experiments to see if a
new variety or breen works better or not.   This constitutes
a vast storehouse of knowledge that can't scale beyond what
the farmer can control.  Once this threshold has been
crossed, the farm might become larger but it will
increasingly become less efficient as the farmer will have
to reduce the complexity level to be able to control it.
Systemic problems will begin to appear, slowly at first and
then frequently and more severely.  Pests, soil depletion,
waster and waste management, disease and the less
flexibility there will be when a crop is ready to go to
market.  When everyting is in basket, you only need to have
one failure that will destroy everything.  In a small farm,
there are many baskets, so the failure of one thing will not
be catastrophic.

The difference bewtween farms in Thailand and Cambodia can
often be dramatic.  Thailand has not experienced war or
civil unrest that has had any real impact on farmers for
more than a century.  Next door in Cambodia the country is
still rebuilding from the temporary insantity of the Khmer
Rogue who systematically wiped out all local knowledge,
often by killing those with that knowledge, and trying to
replace it with a legible state system based on a very
simplistic model that did not take into account local
conditions, human nature and limitations, or much of
anything that wasn't contained in a single slender book that
was little more than a pamplet.  Human civilization can not
be reduced to something that can fit in your pocket.
Decades later the farmers in Cambodia are still going
through the slow process of becoming familiar with their
farms and how to farm them.  This is a process that takes
generations and decades.  And it doesn't help that most
outside help has been in the form of forcing them to adopt
epistemic techniques used by large farms rather than to
reinvent what had been lost.  They are not being allowed to
go back to reclaim what they have lost before being allowed
to go forward. The difference is visible even to the
untrained observer.

We've been quite hard on the epistemic and synoptic so far
but that doesn't mean they should or even can be abandoned.
Most human progress in the past two hundred years has come
from developing epistemic and synoptic forms of knowledge
and seeing.  

Familiarity and isolation often go hand in hand.  One may
have mastered the local, but have no knowledge of the
global.  More often this traps people in one place and
context.  The epistemic and synoptic opens up the entire
world to us, something that most of humanity up until recent
times has been trapped in.  The local becomes a barrier
where outside knowledge takes a very long time to
penetrate.  News from outside the familiar is filtered only
through filters that change at a slower rate of change in
the faster global pace-layers.  The result is often ignorance,
stagnation and a mistrust of outsiders.  And why not?
Strangers are locally illiterate and don't share enough
common knowledge to make effective knowledge possible.  It
is only when a handful of local people, by accident or
extreme acts of bravery venture beyond their zone of
familiarity and come back to translate what they have
learned.  This is often a failure.  The locals don't want to
hear about anything from outside, and the new experiences
outside had changed the travelers to the point where they
find their old homes to be claustrophobic and confining and
the people their inflexible and incapable of change.

The synoptic and epistemic are a find of lingua franca, a
simple maps that is relatively easy to learn and integrate.
It has to be be simple in order to work at large scales.
This lingua franca only works when it is based comminality
shared between everyone, on universals that anyone can
easily recognize and comprehend.

In this way, we make what Steward Branch called "the
progress... from hick to metropolitan to cosmopolitan,
and everything the dictionary says that cosmopolitan means:
multicultural, multiracial, global, worldly-wise, well
traveled, experienced, unprovincial, cultivated, cultured,
sophisticated, suave, urbane." cite:brand:2010whole-earth-discipline

They synopic has made possible for over 7 billion people,
heading towards 10 billions to be able to live together on
this planet with increasingly less bloodshed and at an
increasingly better standard of living.  This has allowed
humans to cooperate on a scale that would have been
unimaginable two hundred years ago.  It has greatly reduced
the threat of war, nearly doubled our lifespans, wiped out
pain and disease and discomfort to a degree that our
ancestors could not have imagined.  The average person
living above the poverty line has, in many respects a far
better standard of living and wealth than the rich and most
powerful monarches in past Ages.  Even in the nineteenth
century, Queen Victoria, arguably the richest and most
powerful person on the planet at the time was terrified at
the prospect of first getting pregnant because of the
dangers of childbirth.

But living only the at the global strips us of much of what
it is to be human it denies us participing in any
substantive community, fragments relationships with parents,
children, friends and lovers.  It leaves us living in a
sterile environment striped of meaning, purpose, intimacy
and belonging.  The admonition to "think localy and act
globally" doesn't cut it.  The stupidity comes in when it's
thought that this needs to be a zero-sum choice, that
everything has to be either metic or epistimic, thinking
that they can't exist at the same time and reinforce each
other rather than forcing us to be smart locally and dumb
and lost globally, or smart globally but any familiarity
that as Olson said, quoting Heraclitus, leaves us estranged
from what we are most familar.  If anything this work is an
attempt to reconcile those two extremes in a way that we can
embrace the advantages of both.

We must all learn to become holons with a dual nature that,
allow us to be both local and familiar wholes /and/ global
and cosmopolitan parts of something larger than ourselves.

Now here comes the catch, this all sounds wonderful, but the
truth is that not many people can do this.  Most of us can
be local and isolated or global and connected and largely
miserable.  We can grok the idea of having two natures, but
to be able to internalize and switch between them is pushing
the envelope on humam cognitive limits.  it would seem that
this leaves humantity in a conundrum where we have to choose
between two different modes of living which are moth
limiting and liberating in different ways.

What we haven't factored into this dilemma our unique human
ability to extend and externalize both our mind and bodies.
This process started with our ability to make tools, then
reached a complexity threshold when speech emerged, and then
another when writing systems emerged and then again when we
learned to connect complex tools (machines) to external
power sources that could be turned on and off at will, first
steam, then petrochemical and finally electrical.  Most
recently we crossed the remarkable threshold of being able
to combine all of these things in machines that could think,
by employing a primitive form of reading and writing which
gave us computers which are not being used to control
machines on our behalf.  And as if this wasn't monumental
enough we have learned not only to read our own genetic code
which has evolved over billions of years using a brutal
random mechananism and will soon be able to rewrite that
code as easily as we now write a rant on facebook.  Humanity
is a storu of steady progression of learning to extend and
externalize ourselves and in doing so connecting us together
and soon reconnecting us to the world around us.

Warp & Woof is an attempt to bring the formidable array of
cognitive tools, knowledge and technology to make it
possible for most people to be able have dual metic and
epistemic natures.  We believe that this could result in the
crossing of another complexity threshold that will allow us
to fix many of the problems of industrial civilization and
begin building a post-industrial and post-scarcity
civiliztion that makes us not just more prosperous, but to
return to a life of purpose and meaning that was lost in the
psycological industrial barrens.

This is still only part of the story, because if we can
restore the local without having to abandon the global we
can learn to put mastery and familiarity back into common
practice and make a decentralized antifragile network of
many locals more efficient than our present fragile
centralized system that favors the few over the many.

This is a vision for a better future, not a utopian
paradise.  I suspect that paradise is not what it's cracked
up to be any way.  No matter how much we try to improve
things humans are quirky and more often than not, complete
flakes.  The bones of the universe only promise uncertainty,
entropy and chaos as the norn with order and life as they
exception.  We need to learn to accept that and get on as
best as we can.  That doesn't mean that we can't make
progress, just that we progress towards an infinate horizon
that we can never reach.  Personally I wouldn't have it any
other way.

This is the vision that informs and guides this work. Now,
follow the bouncing ball, altogether...




One of the big advantages of a role-based identity model is
that it perserves the contextual contextual three letter
soup that we will be introducing in Cantos II, III and IV,
that we call the /5 Cardinal Perspectives/: rate-of-change
(ROC), level-of-detail (LOD), level-of-abstraction (LOA),
level-of-change (LOC) and the process-of-change (POC).  When
we switch roles, our knowledge workshop swaps out the model
and information we use in that role for a different model
that uses a different contexual mix of perspectives that
constitutes a Point of View which constitutes a
context-based WorldView.

Once we have added these tools and become familiar with them
and how to use them within a variety of different frameworks
like a role-based identity model, we can then begin to find
ways of restoring a balance between the Metic and the
Epistemic.

This obviously has to be rewritten so that it is a summary
rather than given as an specific example used as summary.

The premise is that it is helpful to always understand the
Point of View (POV) -- or perspective that you are looking
at something because when you change your POV you change the
context of what you are seeing and will often see things you
didn't see before, or even see things in a completely
different way than you saw before.

We define five Cardinal Perspectives (CP):

  - LOD : Level of Detail      - near <--> far
  - ROC : Rate of Change       - slow <--> fast
  - LOA : Level of Abstraction - specific <--> abstract
  - LOC : Level of Complexity  - simple <--> complex 
  - POC : Process of Change    - start <--> finish

These five Perspectives form the foundation for how
everything else *everything* in APPL, Primer & Hoard are
understood.

Each CP becomes increasingly more complex and abstract, but
each builds on the one before and let's you see the same
thing from a different perspective.  It does not negate the
other POVs so much as enriches them and provides a more
powerful toolbox for modeling and understanding.

For example, let's look at the Origin Story that will start
the Primer.

The Origin LOD is basically Big History -- a linear timeline
with a beginning (big bang) middle (from BB to now) and the
end (projected heat death of the universe).  The narrative
is organized around tipping points where complexity reaches
a critical mass that changes the nature of the universe, and
then later life on earth and eventually us.  This is a
fantastic narrative and is a perfect way of easing people
into the origin story which can be understood like any other
origin story.

The Origin ROC is basically a finer grained version of Big
History that uses the concept of causal propagation (think
Light Cones) to understand that different things change at
different speeds and that all of these things are mixed
together.  It's the embodiment of Gibson's the future is
already here isn't just not evenly distributed.  Brand's
Pace-Layers is a good way of understanding this, as well as
Light Cones and causal propagation of change happening at
the speed of light but making the point that the speed of
light is the maximum speed that things can propagate, most
things are propagating far slower.

--------

Taken together these three models will give us a set of
powerful tools for understanding, planning, building, and
maintaining civilizations.
