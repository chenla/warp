Now that we understand what a Point of View is, and it's importance
and the three concepts of LOD, ROC and POC we can build the three Core
POVs that will be at the heart of our understanding of the universe,
who and what we are and how to build a civilization from first
principles.

Originally I planned on jumping straight in and describing each of
these as a POV, but the concept of LOD is not the same as an LOD POV.
You can't understand LOD as a POV without understanding ROC and POC.
Each of these things as a POC only can be understood in relation to
the other two.

The first is the Scale Point of View which is dominated by LOD and
distance.  The second is Propagation, which is based on ROC. And
finally the Process Point of View is based on the concept of
everything being in the process of becoming something else.

In the same way, the three POVs are not meant to be used separately,
each builds on the other and hybrid Points of Views that combine them
to different degrees will be the rule rather than the exception.
 
So you can think of LOD, ROC and POC and building blocks for
describing context as a POV.  It's important to understand them as
different POVs but in practice we will almost always be talking in
terms of LOD, ROC and POC.

You can mix and match these three to create any number of POVs, but we
will focus on four which will provide a jumping off point for creating
a wide variety of POVs that we will use over and over.
