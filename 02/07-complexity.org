** Scope

The complexity perspective differs from other of the five
perspectives because of state or phase-change.  LOD simply
moves closer or father away in whatever increments you
like.  But as complexity increases you reach a threshold
that reaches a tipping point where a change of state
occurs.  The most familiar example is water, below 0C water
turns a solid, above 100C and water turns into a gas and
in between it is a liquid.  In ecological succession, the
entire ecosystem transforms at each stage.  In human
organizations, small simple groups tend to be more
egalitarian and adapt quickly, as organizations reach
specific sizes their character changes and they neeed to
reorganize and become less nimble the larger they get.  This
is the reason that the Governance Pace-Layer is slower than
the Infrastructure-Layer.  Governance on a smaller scale it
far more adaptive and can change faster than infrastructure.
