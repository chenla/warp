  - An Identity Model
    - External Identities
    - Internal Identities
    - What the model is not
      - not a label, lifestyle choice, class, nationality,
        gender (biological or self-assigned), sexual
        orientation, generation, occupation, ethnic group
        (aka race), religious, ideological or political
        belief or affiliation).
      - Individuals
      - Groups
  - Social Paritioning
  - Privacy needs to be tied to accountability
  - Access Control
  - Authentication
  - Anonymity -> needs to be used as a check and balance,
    but not as a means of hoarding wealth or doing nasty
    shit to other people.  So anonymity has to be tied to
    accountability as well.  How?  That's a very hard
    problem, but it is important that we solve this.
    Anonymity is one of the best tools for combating a wide
    range of evils, so if we can find a way for anyone to
    speak anonymously and ensure that they it can not be
    abused, then we might be on to something.  Perhaps,
    there could be a mechanism that if you abuse that right,
    it will punish you, but not expose you?  How the fuck
    could that work?
