** Scope

** TL;DR

#+begin_quote
This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that
provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting
with four types of joints, the revolute joint, sliding joint, cam
joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and
belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid
parts that connect these joints.

What is Machine?

A machine is mechanism or a combination of mechanism which,
apart from imparting definite motion to the part, also
transmit and modified the available energy into some kind of
desired work. It is neither a source of energy nor a
producer of work but helps in proper utilization of the
same. The motive power has to be derived from external
sources.

Now come out what is MECHANISM -

A combination of a number of bodies assembled in such a way
that the motion of one cause constrained and predictable
motion to the other.

What is machine tool ? 

Any stationary power-driven machine that is used to shape or
form parts made of metal or other materials.

There is a lot of overlap between a tool and machine.

A tool is generally an extension of the human body that is powered by
human muscle and typically directly comes into contact with the
material it is working with.

Machines are often complex externally powered mechanisms that provide
a complex mechanism (as does the human body for a tool) that directs
and controls it.

Most things things we will call machines here are mechanical or
cognitive systems.

We divide machines into two classes, machine-clockwork (or clockwork
machines) and machine-cognition (or cognitive machines).
Machine-clockwork require the direction or operation of a
self-directed agent.  Machine-cog is a machine which is semi-or-fully
self-directed, can recognize patterns, make decsions and learn.

*** Clockwork
**** Matter
Just as with tools, there are machines which are used to manipulate
and shape phyisical things.  There are machines for moving matter from
one place to another.
**** Energy
There are machines for generating power by capturing it in one form
and transfering it to another form.
**** Information
There are also machines that manipulate information.  These are
divided into, transmission, computation and memory.  We call these
types of information machines machine-clockwork because they require
direction from a cognitive agent.
*** Cognitive
A human is a combination clock-work and cognitive-machine.  A Cray
Supercomputer running machine learning applications is a cognitive
machine.  A self-contained robot is, like a human, both clockwork and
self-directed.

*** Hard, Wet and Soft Machines
