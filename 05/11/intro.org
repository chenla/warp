** Scope
** TL;DR

Infrastructure needs to be general -- outline of vehicles
below is too specific and needs to go into the primer.

Infrastructure is all about flow networks -> things that
move through a network, such as vehicles, electricity,
information, money, water, and waste.

Again, infrastructure will be Hard, Wet and Soft but it will
also be a stack with physical, transport, protocol layers
etc.  There will be several stacks, transport, utilities,
security, financial, judicial, diplomatic and political.

Infrastructure is also broken into succession stages that
should, when possible be reversible and gracefully degrade.

Infrastructure embodies not only physical networks, but
institutional processes such as functions performed by
libraries, judiciary, military, diplomacy, healthcare,
education and financial systems.

Finally infrastructure needs to be understood in terms of
shearing layers, with different layers having different 
rates of change.

** Move to Primer

  - infrastructure stack
    - power
    - fuel
    - waste
    - water
    - information
    - tranportation (physical and virtual)
      - roads, waterways, airspace
      - maps of physical space
      - what's happening in that space 
        -- weather, traffic, potholes, accidents etc.
    - vehicles
      - physical vehicles
        - types: trucks, drones, ships, cars, trains
        - ownership or self-ownership
        - finance
        - storage
        - maintainance
        - parts supply chain
        - decomissioning and recycling 
      - status (working, maintainance, replacement)
      - energy to run vehicles
        - fuel -- and fuel stations
        - grid -- recharge, third-rail etc
      - agents for piloting vehicles
      - systems for managing traffic
      - logistic mapping and routing
