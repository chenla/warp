** Scope

This canto was just recently renamed to /provisioning/ and
I'm just starting to think through what that means.  First,
provisioning was the correct word to use, in the sense of
setting things up and make ready to run.

In our case, this will mean an expanded concept that
includes network and server provisioning, as well as initial
planning, design and bringing the system online.

We will need a toolchain to do these things.

  - a package management system for different modules and
    add on modes.
  - a configuration management system along the same lines
    as Chef.
  - a build and continuous deployment system 
  - a monitor and administration system for distributed
    infrastructure.

We could cobble this together using existing tools, and in
the early days that's what we will do.  We can use
Kubernetes, GitLab, Chef etc.  But that only gets us so far.
These are all tools for managing hardware and software.  The
system is designed to be homoiconographic, and work as
literate computing/programs so source code is not just code,
but content as well.

In fact the system has to work as a paper-based system if
being run in a mechanical succession stage, and we will
eventually maintain running systems that will work at each
succession stage, so that the lower stages -- this is the
only way that we can ensure that when things go wrong that
the systems will continue to work and work well within the
constraits of the succession stage.

We will also be running IOT devices and coordinate
semi-autonomous systems as well.  The existing provisioning
stack is not up to that.

** TL;DR
Volume V outlines the major components in the process of
building a civilization and the workflow between each
component.

*** Warp & Woof
Warp & Woof defines the principles, assumptions and
concepts that the system is based on.

*** A Pace-Layer Pattern Language (APPL)
A Pace-Layer Pattern Language defines archetypal patterns
that can be combined and adapted to build a civilization.

*** Hoard
Hoard is the source-code, which pulls together all of
the pieces from APPL adapts them into a system that
works together.

There are three major components required in every hoard
that will either be inherited (hoards employ a cascading
model) or there will be at least partial translation and
variations of Origin, Curriculum and Articles which, must be
common across all expressions of a human distributed
civilization.  These are not static but living narratives
and commonly held tennants for all of humanity that are
based on humanistic principles of reason, science and
progress, which come to us from the Englightenment.  These
are not dogmatic or sacrosanct so long as any changes to
them follow a ruleset that ensure that they don't drift over
time into justifications for tyranny, violence and
injustice.  Our origin story is still being written, and it
might never be completed so it will undergo the most churn,
so long as any changes reflect rational scientific
evidence-based consensus.

*** Primer
Primer is the compiled, running production version of the
Hoard.  Changes are made to the Hoard and then merged with
the Primer using a rolling continious release mechanism.
The primer is a bit like a genome, the RNA that translates
the DNA into the Hoard into what it describes.

*** Middle
Middle is the larger physical and informational
infrastructure that is generated from the Primer. Middle is
the day to day operation and management.  You can think of
Middle as being the body that was generated from your DNA.
In most cases, things that happen in your body don't have
any effect on your DNA, but in rate instances it might,
especially when you combine your DNA with someone elses to
produce offspring.

*** Arc
Arc is designed to be outside of the entire system, which
contains the collected recorded memory and experience of a
civilization.  All the books, news stories, software,
tweets, emails, transaction logs, pictures, medical records
etc. are all collected by ARC.  Over time, ARC consolidates,
summarizes, discarding duplicates and identifying things
that are important to be remembered indefinately.  But this
is a very slow process measured in decades, centuries and
millennia.  Arc is the memory of all civilizations and so is
an intimate inseparable part of any civilization but it is
also outside and above it and designed to survive every
possible threat that can be concieved.  ARC is
self-replicating, self-supporting, it is both completely
open and transparent but it is also secret so that it can
survive everything from natural catastrophes, benign
neglect, temporary instanity of those who want to destroy or
rewrite the past.
