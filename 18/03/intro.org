** Scope
** TL;DR

The Primer is the Hoard after it has been compiled, deployed
running production.

In our case, this will take a number of physical and
electronic forms depending on the succession stage the that
reader belongs to.

The primer is structured like a multi-level labyrinth, with
no Minotaur in the middle.  Each level is designed so that
it forms the foundational prerequisites for the next level.
This is not a quest or a game, the reason for this structure
is both pedantic and pragmatic.  


As Vernor Vinge repeatedly observed, you need an industrial
civilization to build an industrial civilization.  You can't
build an AI until you have a computer, you can't build a
computer (with apologies to Babbage) unless you have
integrated circuits, you can't have integrated circuits
unless you have an electrified mechanical industrial
infrastructure, you can't have an electrified mechanical
infrastructure unless you have an industrial infrastructure
to electrify and you can build that ingrastructure without a
base pre-electrical civilization, with a stable means of
providing the base levels of Maslow's hierarchy; food,
shelter, health, saftey and the free time to learn and
experiment.

So each level will be designed using media appropriate to
that succession stage.  Stone and etched metal for basic
pictoral information to get one started and stay alive,
paper for those who have basic literate and numerative
skills, and eventually dynamic machine graphical interfaces
and perhaps more advanced types of interfaces when the
technology becomes available.

If we think of the Primer as being a multi-layered fabric
made up of threads that compromise its warp and woof, then
the Primer is the mechanism that acts as a skein, a thread
or path through each layer of fabric and then from layer to
layer.

It is important to understand that we are building a
/Distributed/ civilization.  Each Hoard is designed to be an
expression of the place it will be used in, and over time
those changes will become deeper and richer.  Changes which
are intrinsic to a place and climate and fashion of a given
succession stage and the historical and cultural context of
the place and people will shape h There is no one Primer to
Rule them all.  Primers will be built for different
seccession stages, for individuals, for students at
different ages or levels of skill and knowledge, there will
be primers for masters, and hobbiests, for groups and
organizations of different sizes and purposes.  In other
words a Primer is a Holon that is part of a larger Holarchy.
The trick is to ensure that all primers remain interoperable
with each other at all scales and in all contexts.  For
example, succession stages will not be be global for a very
long time.  As William Gibson said, they just aren't evenly
distributed, so interoperability in terms of being able
gracefully degrade or to upgrade is especially important to
ensure that everyone progresses at the pace that they are
able to and remain in their comfort zone, while ensuring
that no one is being excluded or being held back.

As the good Doctor Thompson put it, you buy your ticket, you
take the ride.  And it's vital that everyone gets a ticket.
