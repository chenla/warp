   - offset crazy-ass ROC

 - slow governance
 - long term investment -> bread cast apon the water
   - moonshots
   - builds the impossible
 - collective memory
   - don't repeat past mistakes
   - collect, preserve and curate the present
 - guardians of the commons -> this must be central part of 
                               governance articles
 - continuity
   - structures of daily life
   - vernacular architecture & design

       scratch are not being honest with themselves and are
       just making a mess of things.
