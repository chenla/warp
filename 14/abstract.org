** Scope



** TL;DR

Small is beautiful

  - based on everything being property that can be bought and sold.
  - economies are systems, which need to mapped (modeled) not only
    measured.
  - economic models are too simple to track enough parameters to model
    the complexity of economic systems.

Starting to read /Small is Beautiful/ which is fun.  It's interesting
to read about speculations of what the year 2000 will be like from
thirty years before that.  In many ways he got it right.

But it's also gratifying to see that I came up with many of his
conclusions independently.  The difference is that today, I think that
the technology is here to actually realise some of these ideas.

The TLS lists it as one of the most influential books of published
since WWII.  I don't know who he influenced but none of them went into
economics or politicis or business :)

The book is from an economist's POV.
