** TL;DR

Fifty years is an interesting period of time 




A Roadmap for Mankind over the next 50 years to move from
being a centralized global civilization, with crtical
knowledge, infrastructure and wealth pooled in a handful of
people, places, and organizations, to a distributed
multiplanetary civilization reflecting the needs of a
rapidly shrinking population on earth and an increasingly
hostile climate.

Elon Musk has said on several occasions that we have a very
short window to become a multi-planet species, if we don't
do it soon, we may never be able to do it.

  - low hanging fruit picked :: Peak Cheap Non-Renewable
       Energy, which made the industrial revolution and the
       information revolution possible -- if the present
       level of civilization collapses, these resources will
       not be available to rebuild.

  - Population Collapse :: if we fall below MV for
       technological civilization to continue to innovate at
       same level, which is needed to solve:

  - Constant Battles :: man's tendency to to self-destruct

  - Climate change   :: spend too much time on survival

We have to have our shit together within 50 years, to begin
making substantial change or we may not have the time,
resources, or number of people needed to solve the big
problems

** The Fifty Year Window

#+begin_quote
But science as a whole proceeds apace. We pour in more
effort, more manpower, and greater ingenuity into further
discovery and knowledge. A simple example is one of the
first quantities to be studied in the field of
scientometrics: the number of scientists over time. The
first U.S. PhDs were granted by Yale University
in 1861. Since that time the number of scientists in the
United States and throughout the world has increased
rapidly. For example, the membership of scientists in the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
increased from fewer than five hundred in the year 1920 to
well over fifty thousand by the late 1990s. This hundredfold
increase is extremely rapid in a period of less than eighty
years and is indicative of the increase in scientific power
through sheer numbers of scientists.

In fact, if you uttered the statement “Eighty percent of all
the scientists who have ever lived are alive today” nearly
anytime in the past three hundred years, you’d be
right. This has allowed more research to be done by larger
scientific teams. Not only that, but higher-impact research
is done by teams with many more scientists. Of course,
growth like this is not sustainable—a long exponential
increase in the number of scientists means that at some
point the number of scientists would need to exceed the
number of humans on Earth. While this may almost be the case
on Krypton, Superman’s home planet, where the whole
population seems to consist entirely of scientists, I don’t
see this happening on Earth anytime soon. But this rapid
growth demonstrates that scientific discovery is by no means
anywhere near finished.
