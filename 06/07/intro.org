** Scope
** TL;DR

Agency is an interesting work, it can be a physical location of an
agent or a whole organization with a stated purpose, it can be a verb
to have the capacity or authority to do something.

An agent is an abstract term, like an observer.  In fact an observer
is a type of agent.  Agents can be a go-between or facilitator, such
as a solicitor or lawyer or someone who arranges sales of properties.
And of course there is everyone's favorite, the secret agent, who is a
spy working to gather intelligence from a party without their
knowledge or approval.

Our use the term agency borrows a bit from all of them, but in
particular as an agent or group of agents who maintain and direct
running processes.  An agent can be a human being, a clockwork or
cognitive machine.

Agency is the stand in term we will use to denote any organizations
who maintain running processes, including anything from a mom and pop
corner store, to a multinational business or even a self-declared
sovereign state.

Agency is the process of running processes, just as second-order
cybernetics can be said to be the study of uderstanding understanding.

What we want to do here is to outline the requirements and principles
and patterns for how to run and coordinate a living distributed
civilization.  In otherwords, this is the operator's operating manual
for civilization.  This is, as people say in IT, non-trivial.
