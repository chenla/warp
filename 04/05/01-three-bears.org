** The Story of the Three Bears, versified by George Nicol, 2nd ed. 1839

#+begin_verse 
[.ill #1]


Three Bears, once on a time, did dwell
   Snug in a house together.
Which was their own, and suited well
   By keeping out the weather.

’Twas seated in a shady wood. 
   In which they daily walk’d. 
And afterwards, as in the mood. 
   They smok’d and read, or talk’d. 

One of them was a great huge Bear, 
   And one of a middle size. 
The other a little, small, wee Bear, 
   With small red twinkling eyes. 

A chair there was for every Bear, 
   When they might choose to sit; 
The huge Bear had a great huge chair. 
   And filled it every bit. 

The middle Bear a chair had he 
   Of a middle-size and neat; 
The Bear so little,, small, and wee 
   A little, small, wee seat 

They, also, each one had a bed 
   To sleep upon at night; 
The huge Bear’s was a great, huge bed. 
   In length, and width, and height. 

The middle Bear laid down his head 
   On a bed of middle-size; 
The wee Bear on a small, wee bed 
   Did nightly close his eyes. 

“A burnt child dreads the fire”—A Bear 
   Doth dread it just as much. 
As these Bears proved, in taking care 
   Their porridge not to touch. 

[.ill #2]

For they most cautious had become 
   From having once before 
Their mouths severely burnt with some, 
   Which made them dance and roar! 

They, therefore, let their breakfast be 
   Till it should cooler grow— 
And meantime for a walk the three 
   Into the wood did go. 

And now a little old woman there 
   Came, whilst the Bears were out; 
Through window, keyhole, wverywhere. 
   She peep’d and peer’d about: 

And then she lifted up the latch 
   And through the door she went, 
For hold of all she could to snatch 
   No doubt was her intent. 

[.ill #3]

The Bears had left the door undone 
   Whilst strolling in the wood, 
For they suspected harm from none 
   They were, themselves, so good 

The little old Dame had entered in, 
   And was well pleased to find 
The porridge-pots, and that within 
   They held food of such kind. 

Now had she waited till home came 
   The Bears, most likely they 
To breakfast might have asked the Dame, 
   And begg’d of her to stay. 

But she was impudent and bold. 
   And cared for none a pin; 
So quickly of a spoon laid hold 
   The porridge to dip in. 

And first out of the great Bear’s pot 
   The porridge she did taste, 
Which proving to be very hot 
   She spat it out in haste. 

She burn’d her mouth, at which half mad 
   She said a naughty word; 
A naughty word it was and bad. 
   As ever could be heard. 

The middle Bear’s she tasted next, 
   Which being rather cold, 
She disappointed was, and vext, 
   And with bad words did scold.

But now to where the small, wee Bear 
   Had left his small, wee cup 
She came, and soon the porridge there 
   By her was eaten up. 

[.ill #4]

A wicked word she spoke again 
   As wicked as before, 
Because this pot did not contain 
   Many a spoonful more. 

Then down the little old woman sat 
   Within the huge Bear's chair, 
But much too hard for her was that,
   And so she staid not there. 

Next she tried the middle-sized one 
   And that too soft she found; 
Then sat the small, wee chair upon,
   Which fitted her all round. 

Now here for sometime sat the Dame 
   Till half inclined to snore, 
When out this wee chair’s bottom came 
   And her’s came on the floor 

[.ill #5]

A wicked word about this too 
   She spoke—then went up-stairs, 
And poked her ugly head into 
   The bed-room of the Bears. 

And down upon the huge Bear’s bed 
   She lay, which was too high 
To suit her little ugly head, 
   Which easy could not lie. 

Then to the middle Bear’s she goes 
   And quick upon it got, 
But at the foot too high it rose, 
   And so she liked it not. 

Now down upon the small wee bed 
   She lay, and it was quite 
The thing, both at the foot and head, 
   And fitted her just right.

[.ill #6]

Thus finding that it suited well
   Within the clothes she crept; 
Then soon into a slumber fell 
   And snug and soundly slept. 

Although the morning sun shone bright 
   And birds did sweetly sing, 
She slept, as if it had been night, 
   This sad, old, lazy thing. 

The three Bears in their jackets rough 
   Now came in from the wood, 
Thinking their porridge long enough 
   To cool itself had stood. 

*"Somebody has at my porridge been !"*
   The huge Bear’s gruff voice cried;
For there the spoon was sticking in, 
   Which he left at the side. 

[.ill #7

*“Somebody has at my porridge been!”* 
   Then said the middle Bear, 
For also in his pot was seen 
   The spoon, which made him stare.

These spoons were wooden spoons, not made 
   Of silver, else full soon 
This wicked Dame would, I’m afraid,
   Have pocketed each spoon. 

The small Bear’s small voice said, as in 
   He peer’d to his wee cup, 
“Somebody has at my porridge been. 
   And eaten it all up!"           <-- quote in smaller font"

On this the three Bears finding that 
   The while they had been out, 
Some one the door had entered at, 
   Began to look about. 

[.ill #8]

*"Somebody in my chair has sat!"* 
  With voice so gruff and great 
The huge Bear said, when he saw that 
  His cushion was not straight. 

*“Somebody in my chair has been !”* 
   The middle Bear exclaim'd; 
Seeing the cushion dinted in 
   By what may not be named. 

Then said the little small wee Bear, 
   Looking his chair into,
"Some one’s been sitting in my chair. 
   And sat the bottom through I”   <-- small font

Now having search'd the house below 
   Most prudently these Bears, 
Thought it just as well to go 
   And do the same up-stairs. 

[.ill #9]

*"Some one’s been lying in my bed!* 
   Cried out the great huge Bear, 
Who left his pillow at the head 
   And now it was not there. 

*“Some one’s been lying in my bed !"* 
   The middle Bear then cried, 
For it was tumbled at the head 
   And at the foot and side.

** Notes

This text is the first record in narrative form by British writer and
port Robert Southey.

First published anonymously as "The Story of the Three Bears" in 1837
in a collection of his writings called /The Doctor/.

** Appendix

*NOTE*: Include the full original narrative version in the appendix for
four reasons:

  1. Partly because if the antagonist is a little girl, it changes the
     moral of the story that children should not be little brats.
  2. When used to teach the Goldilock Principle, have students read
     the first verse version at the beginning of the section.  And
     then have them read the original narrative version the next time
     that the golilocks story is invoked as a way of reinforcing the
     story.
  3. I hope to include a number of stories like the three bears
     throughout w&w -- to show how mythological narratives are a
     critical way of understanding outselves and the cultures we live
     in.
  4. It's charming and I am rather fond of both versions.

*** The Three Bears By Robert Southby

In a far-off country there was once a little girl who was called
Silver-hair, because her curly hair shone brightly. She was a sad
romp, and so restless that she could not be kept quiet at home, but
must needs run out and away, without leave.

One day she started off into a wood to gather wild flowers, and into
the fields to chase butterflies. She ran here and she ran there, and
went so far, at last, that she found herself in a lonely place, where
she saw a snug little house, in which three bears lived; but they were
not then at home.

The door was ajar, and Silver-hair pushed it open and found the place
to be quite empty, so she made up her mind to go in boldly, and look
all about the place, little thinking what sort of people lived there.

Now the three bears had gone out to walk a little before this. They
were the Big Bear, and the Middle-sized Bear, and the Little Bear; but
they had left their porridge on the table to cool. So when Silver-hair
came into the kitchen, she saw the three bowls of porridge. She tasted
the largest bowl, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too
cold; then she tasted the middle-sized bowl, which belonged to the
Middle-sized Bear, and found it too hot; then she tasted the smallest
bowl, which belonged to the Little Bear, and it was just right, and
she ate it all.

She went into the parlour, and there were three chairs. She tried the
biggest chair, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too high;
then she tried the middle-sized chair, which belonged to the
Middle-sized Bear, and she found it too broad; then she tried the
little chair, which belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just
right, but she sat in it so hard that she broke it.

Now Silver-hair was by this time very tired, and she went upstairs to
the chamber, and there she found three beds. She tried the largest
bed, which belonged to the Big Bear, and found it too soft; then she
tried the middle-sized bed, which belonged to the Middle-sized Bear,
and she found it too hard; then she tried the smallest bed, which
belonged to the Little Bear, and found it just right, so she lay down
upon it, and fell fast asleep.

While Silver-hair was lying fast asleep, the three bears came home
from their walk. They came into the kitchen, to get their porridge,
but when the Big Bear went to his, he growled out:

“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TASTING MY PORRIDGE!”

and the Middle-sized Bear looked into his bowl, and said:

“Somebody Has Been Tasting My Porridge!”

and the Little Bear piped:

“Somebody has tasted my porridge and eaten it all up!”

Then they went into the parlour, and the Big Bear growled:

“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!”

and the Middle-sized Bear said:

“Somebody Has Been Sitting In My Chair!”

and the Little Bear piped:

“Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has broken it all to pieces!”

So they went upstairs into the chamber, and the Big Bear growled:

“SOMEBODY HAS BEEN TUMBLING MY BED!”

and the Middle-sized Bear said:

“Somebody Has Been Tumbling My Bed!”

and the little Bear piped:

“Somebody has been tumbling my bed, and here she is!”

At that, Silver-hair woke in a fright, and jumped out of the window
and ran away as fast as her legs could carry her, and never went near
the Three Bears’ snug little house again.
