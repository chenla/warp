** Scope
** TL;DR

#+begin_quote
I think of Marxism as the Creationism of Economics. Derives it's
self-importance from an outdated but still venerable source of
knowledge. Defends that source rather than tests it. Emphasizes parts
their source happened to get right while glossing over the ones where
it completely failed. Maintains that there's still a controversy even
after everyone outside their bubble knows they lost the factual debate
long ago.

#+end_quote

Until recently I had dismissed ideologies as being maps that once
served a purpose but taken on religious meaning and frozen; Medusa's
gaze turning it into dogmatic stone.

Dogma is a mechanism to reduce copying errors which becomes a problem
when a religion scales beyond a certain size.  When errors are
introduced, religious factions inevitably emerge which come into
conflict with the parent belief system.  There is good reason for
religions to place heresy, which at base is nothing more than
asserting statements that do not align with the normative encoding of
the belief system, as a existential danger and act accordingly.  It's
not surprising that monothesistic religions all emerged after the
widespread adoption of writing systems, and that literacy becomes one
of the primary tools used to spread adoption of those systems.  Large
pantheistic systems were too flexible and make peace with the inherent
uncertainty, and ambiguitiy of the world to be able to scale.
Monothesisms were simple inter-connected clouds of memes designed for
maximum propagation.  In that sense the origins of monothesistic
religions are populist in nature, beginning as, or later evolving into
groups seeking independence from or the overthrow of elites.

All of this applies equally to ideologies.
