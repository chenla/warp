  - Introduction
  - HARD -> define
  - SOFT -> define
  - WET  -> define
  - HSW uses different types of measurement
  - HSW are often different layers in succession stages and stacks
  - There are hard soft and wet elements within each category 
    - DNA/RNA is both Wet (chemical) and Soft (information).
    - Computer Hardware is both Hard (transistors and chips) and Soft
      (bios)



** Scope
** TL;DR

In the second wave of artificial intelligence research, before the
onset of the long AI Winter, it was said that there are three types of
intelligence, Hard, Soft and Wet.  This holds true for understanding
many things from Energy, Infrastructure, etc.

In Japan, it's common for people to use the term Hard and Soft as a
shorthand for Hardware and Software.  We add to that Wet, for
biological processes, but also include in Wet social systems used by
biological systems.  So politics is Wet, while logistics is Soft, and
the electrical grid is Hard.
