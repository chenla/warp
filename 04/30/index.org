  - Replication
    - hard: manufacturing
    - wet:  chemical/biological
    - soft: information
  - Methods of Replication
    - Clone        -> duplicate
    - Grow         -> seccession
    - Fabricate    -> fashion out of raw materials
    - Recombinate  -> merge two variations as in DNA
    - Division     -> as in cell division
    - Assimilation -> additive
  - Tolerances
    In copying, what are the tolerances or amount of variation that is
    allowable for it to be considered a faithful, exact, or rough copy
    of something.  This is an important part of the design or
    specification for what is being replicated.  In the case of many
    things including living organisms or machines with moving parts,
    if tolerances are exceeded, the machine won't work or the organism
    will not survive.  
  - Copy errors
    entropy and complexity makes errors inevitable
    - mutations
    - flaws
    - impurities
    - noise
  - Error Detection
    - comparison with reference instance
    - checksums
    - QA tests
  - Feedback Mechanisms
    - how errors that are detected are then sent to a mechanism for
      correcting them.
  - Error Correction
    Without error correction, copies will continually drift from the
    original with additional errors introduced and then errors will be
    copied and then errors will be made copying errors and so on. This
    the process that changes an event into news, news into history,
    history into legand, and legand into myth.
    - Redundancy
      - example: QR Code
  - Introducing Error
    - bombard dna with radiation to produce mutations
    - evolutionary processes are built on random errors producing
      variations that improve a design.
