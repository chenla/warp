Questions:

What are the equivelent of the Nitrogen Cycle or Groundwater
Recharge Cycle for civilizations?

Pace-Layers are relative to each other -- but is there
another way of looking at that?  Do p-layers need to employ
units of measure?
#+end_comment

Shearing layers are not only for buildings

An axe has a shearing layer of a head and a handle, the
handle has a separate life from the head.

But this is only when a made thing follows the REPAIRABLE
and UPGRADABLE patterns

Machines -- let's use three examples:
  - Cars
  - Washing Machines
  - Computers


** Braudel's Different Speeds of History

A precursor to Brand's Pace-Layer Model was Braudel's idea
of time moving at different speeds, which was summed up
beautifully by Peter Burke:

#+begin_quote
Insofar as this huge book has a general argument, it is that
time moves at different speeds, and that it is useful to
distinguish three ‘temporalities’ in particular. There is
the short term, the time of events, time as it is perceived
by contemporaries; the middle term, the time of ‘economic
systems, states, societies, civilisations’; and finally, the
very long term, the ‘almost timeless history’ of man’s
relation to the environment.

#+end_quote

The slowest of speeds which is "almost imperceptible" are
closest that man get's to the natural environment is are
characterized by cyclical repetition.  For the young who
have not experienced many cycles, these repetitions feel
more like daily cycles that are separated by long intervals,
seasons and the temporal distances between annual events
such as holidays stretch on seemingly forever. And each day
seems to take a long time.  Later in life, we reminisce of
Long Summer days, which if you lived in a northern latitude
indeed were very long with the sun not setting until very
late in the evening in mid-summer.  But when you are young
they streched like an enernity, as did even slow crawl of
the second hand of the clock in a classroom wall for even a
single class.  Every day was a long slow cycle, and years
felt like generational events where you passed milestones
and moved up the physical, social and intellectual ladder
year by slow year. A 15 minute "time-out" where a 4 year old
is ordered to sit in a corner passes in the blink of an eye
to the adult meeting out the punishment.  But to the 4 year
old it feels more like agonizing hours have passed.

This is important to keep in mind when considering the
perception of the passage of time in past ages.  So little
changed from year to year, and between decades and centuries
that time seemed far more cyclical than it does now.
Imagine what modern life was like before the debut of
Apple's iPhone.  It seems so long ago, and yet at the time
that I write this (2018), is has only been a little over 10
years.  A person living in the 15th century wouldn't see
that much change over the span of generations that have
passed out of living memory.  Just as the concept of a
child's ROC is totally out of sync with that of an adult.
The ROC that we are seeing in the first decades of the 21st
century is unprecendented in human history.  The only way to
come to grips with this is to recognize and understand that
the perception of the Rate of Change is relative to the
length of time that takes place between events within the
period being observed, be it the age of the universe, a
lifespan of a species, or the eternity that an American
child feels that takes place between Halloween in October
and Christmas three months later in December.

#+begin_quote
The first part is devoted to a history whose passage is
almost imperceptible, that of man in his relationship to the
environment, a history in which all change is slow, a
history of constant repetition, ever-recurring cycles. I
could not neglect this almost timeless history, the story of
man's contact with the inanimate, neither could I be
satisfied with the traditional geographical introduction to
history that often figures to little purpose at the
beginning of so many books, with its descriptions of the
mineral deposits, types of agriculture, and typical flora,
briefly listed and never mentioned again, as if the flowers
did not come back every spring, the flocks of sheep migrate
every year, or the ships sail on a real sea that changes
with the seasons.

On a different level from the first there can be
distinguished another history, this time with slow but
perceptible rhythms. If the expression had had not been
diverted from its full meaning, one could call it social
history, the history of groups and groupings. How did these
swelling-currents affect Mediterranean life in general --
this was the question I asked myself in the second part of
the book, studying in turn economic systems, states,
societies, civilizations and finally, in order to convey
more clearly my conception of history, attempting to show
how all these deep-seated forces were at work in the complex
arena of warfare. For war, as we know, is not an arena
governed purely by individual responsibilities.

Lastly, the third part gives a hearing to traditional
history - history, one might say, on the scale not of man,
but of individual men, what Paul Lacombe and Francois
Simiand called /'l'histoire événementielle'/, that is, the
history of events: surface disturbances, crests of foam that
the tides of history carry on their strong backs. A history
of brief, rapid, nervous fluctuations, by definition
ultra-sensitive; the least tremor sets all its antennae
quivering. But as such it is the most exciting of all, the
richest in human interest, and also the most dangerous. We
must learn to distrust this history with its still burning
passions, as it was felt, described, and lived by
contemporaries whose lives were as short and as
short-sighted as ours. It has the dimensions of their anger,
dreams, or illusions. In the sixteenth century, after the
true Renaissance, came the Renaissance ofthe poor, the
humble, eager to write, to talk of themselves and of
others. This 'precious mass of paper distorts, filling up
the lost hours and assuming a false importance. The
historian who takes a seat in Philip II's chair and reads
his papers finds himself transported into a strange
one-dimensional world, a world of strong passions certainly,
blind like any other living world, our own included, and
unconscious of the deeper realities of history, of the
running waters on which our frail barks are tossed like
cockleshells. A dangerous world, but one whose spells and
enchantments we shall have exorcised by making sure first to
chart those underlyingcurrents, often noiseless, whose
direction can only be discerned by watching them over long
periods of time. Resounding events are often only momentary
outbursts, surface manifestations of these larger movements
and explicable only in terms of them.

** Notes

***  Proactive long term pace-layer maps

:END:

When we plan, especially when it comes to land use, we need to be
thinking about how things will be 500 years from now, with the plan
being revisited every 50 year scope.

Maps need to be designed around pace layers -- different things change
at different speeds -- if this is reflected in the map, many things
become easier....

These maps can not locked away in a zoning office -- they must be kept
in living memory of the community -- so that everyone knows where they
came from, where they are and where they are collectively going.  so
in a sense they are aspirational, as any long term plan is, but they
are corrected over time, so that it's clear what we got right and what
we got wrong and /learn/ from what we got wrong.  Over many iterations
we'll get better, so long as we keep iterating and remember what
worked and what didn't in the past.


If sea level rise in inevitable, then redraw maps to start moving
people to places that are defensible.  Are regions destined to become
deserts?  Or will have heavy rains, or excessive heat, or places that
are cold today that will be warm tomorrow....

Swamp and marshlands need to be restored.

On Mars we need to be thinking about what things will look like once
terraforming kicks in and the planet heats up and there is liquid
water on the planet again.  Where will the new rivers and seas be.

Plan for different bioregions from day one -- so that settlements
under domes can eventually remove their domes as pressure and heat
increases -- so that eventually the domed natural habitats will fit
the climate that eventually will be in that location.

Then build accordingly.  There is a lot of latitude here because
earthworks can be designed to reinforce these choices within reason.

For planetoids (asteroids, moons etc) there should be broad plans for
what is to be built and done -- locate settlements that won't be
impacted by resource mining and processing -- are you going to hollow
out and spin up an asteroid?  Before you land, have that intention
mapped out and in place so that early initial decsions won't create
problems decades or even centuries later.
