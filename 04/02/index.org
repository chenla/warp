** TL;DR
  


** Keeping the five POV models straight

 - entity
 - succession
 - LOD
 - ROC
 - POC

Thinking about this more I don't think we need to go outside
of the Entity model to include the other models.  All
metadata will be within the entity model, so Succession,
LOD, ROC and POC will be incorporated into it.

In many cases it will simply including a link to which
Pace-Layer or LOD that a burr belongs to.

Perhaps they could be combined as well, we need to have
namespaces for each model no matter what it is, so adding
the prefix and then point to the link is not difficult.  It
would be great to be able to do multiple ones at the same
time.

So you pull up a helm list, a choose items and they get
added to the property box at point.

** thesaurus relationships encoding

As a key-value pair:

  :bt: per:charles_dickens--19c_novelist

  #+BT: per:charles_dickens--19c_novelist

  BT: Charles Dickens (19c_novelist)  | Person tspace

** whole/part relationships

 - BTI, NTI : Instantive
 - BTP, NTP : Partitive

** next/prev reltionships

 - BTF, NTF : forward
 - BTB, BTB : back (previous) 

I prefer Next and Previous but we're already using P for
partitive.

** How to reduce verbosity in file headers?

Use VAL to set the  value for the burr and then a list of
relationships:

   #+LAYER:   VAL=civ:culture BT=civ:governance
   #+STAGE:   VAL=civ:tools  NT=civ:clockwork 
   #+LOD:     VAL=lod:min
   #+ENTITY:  VAL=exp:Christmas_Carol--novela RT=exp:Christmas_Carol--play

Do we want to use entities as tspaces?  I suppose there is
no reason why any burr can't belong to multiple tspaces so
long as they are unique to that tspace.
    
This gives us a relatively compact way of setting a number
of values for each type of model that allows us to create
some very interesting structures.
