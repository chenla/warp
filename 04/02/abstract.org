** Scope
** TL;DR

From way back in the beginning, the idea was to combine
thesaurus relationships with frbr attributes.  Seemed pretty
straight forward at the time.  It wasn't.

I mean, yes, it worked -- early BMF had records broken into
sections and there was meta, which largely held frbr
attributes and then there was a section named /heirarchy/ and
later /tree/.

I've played with using property boxes in org called tree
that was separate from the bog standard PROPERTIES box, but
it never clicked.

A couple of things I learned to cut this down and make
things easier.

  - leveral inheritance where possible
  - never include broader concepts because they should be
    defined as narrower concepts in items higher in the
    heirarchy (which assumes that you always go to that file
    and add it there) it would be better if you add it here,
    then it should be automatically added higher up the tree
    which is not that difficult a trick to pull off in
    elisp.
  - we *REALLY* need a helm interface for searching for and
    adding items.  It will never work by hand.  So that
    means I need to index everything and create a helm
    interface to be able to do that.  It will be a bit of
    work, but I think we're about to the point where this
    has to happen.
  - need a solution to markup inline keywords with broader
    and narrower relationships.  And to do this we need a
    link format that treats links like org-ref citation
    links, so that when you click on it you get a menu of
    what you need to get done.
  - creating templates from the record in the buffer could
    also automate things -- so if you have made a work
    entity record, click and get a menu and it will ask you
    if you want to make another work, or an expression of
    that work.
  - pull informtion from bibtex records to create a burr
    from each one.
  - create person records from author fields in bibtex
    records.
  - tangle bibtex files from burs.

That's a lot of elisp, but again, we're getting to the point
where the structure is mature enough to start making these
tools.  Before the structure was too fluid and changing too
often to justify making the tools.
