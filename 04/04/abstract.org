** Scope
** TL;DR

My original idea was to use pace-layers as the primary
organizational scaffolds for w&w.  Then it all drifted into
being a massive linear narrative -- too massive.  the whole
fucking thing is too complex on two many levels to be a
long-form linear narrative.  So let's return to a looser
framework that combines sort of a whole earth catalog
approach with the original loose-leaf binder concept behind
APL.

Cantos are no longer narratives -- but rather an
introductory essay that provides a narrative and then a
mashup of supporting patterns, parameters, events, people
etc that create a kind of map for the introduction -- that
taken together is a whole, though many of the different
parts might also belong to other Cantos (tho at different
LOD/POV etc.)

This is actually what I was trying to get at with the TL;DR
idea but was thinking of them at that time as being sidebar
rabbit-holes.  The whole earth approach is far better.

---

Whole Earth was organized around half a dozen or so major
themes that tied together each section and worked well.
Since w&w will be multi-volume each volume should be a
keystone concept that is then broken into several sections.

I've been thinking about making the first volume about
pace-layers but I'm coming to the conclusion that this would
not be digging deep enough.  What may work is the idea of
"propagation" of information which pace-layers is built on
top of.  Pace-layers, as originally laid out by Brand was
about ROC, but ROC is only one aspect of what is really
going on -- wwe must include how that change propagates both
through space, time and vertically to higher and lower
layers.

This gives us a far more nuanced model -- becuase the faster
the rate of change, the less stable it is, but also, the
faster that those changes propagate.  The slower the ROC the
slower the propagation -- at least that's what you'd think
is the case -- is it actually true?  Is the pace of change
correspond to the speed at which it propagates?  No.  The
network layer -- the layer in the protocol stack that moves
information is limited by physical laws -- the ultimate
brake is the speed of light.  So at short distances the
speed of light is effectively instantaneous -- so
information propagates instantly irrespective of it's rate
of change.  But as distance increases, this no longer holds.
Most information does not travel at the speed of light.

When you go to see a live rocket launch in person,
spectators are kept at a considerable distance for safety
reasons.  Rockets tend to be rather large affairs -- with
most rockets today (circa 2018) being about the size of the
twenty storey building.  So even if you are several
kilometers away the rocket is easy to see.  When the rocket
first ignites and begins to take off, there is no sound.
That takes a few seconds longer for the sound and vibrations
to reach you.  And other things take still further.  Smoke
and ash from a volcano would arrive after seeing the
eruption and then hearing it.

This is not a bad way of thinking about pace-layers -- but
it might be more useful to not think of layers as a curved
stack as in Stewart Brand's diagram, but as layers in an
onion -- where each layer is like the surface of a puddle in
the rain with drops impacting the puddle creating concentric
waves of rings that collide, combine and merge with those of
other drops with the magnitude of the ripples decreasing the
further they get from the center of impact.

Changes, both large and small might take place anywhere and
changes will eventually propagate over the entire surface of
the sphere.
