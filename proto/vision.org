** First Facts (Scope)

If we continue roughly on the path we are on now, in the next 50
years:

  - World Population will grow from 7.5 billion to somewhat over 10
    billion. But the next 50 years will see population decline -- but
    two factors will change the UN's scenarios -- extreme poverty will
    decline faster in poorest nations with women's education and
    decline in child mortality accelerating faster than is projected.
    And second, breakthroughs in medical science will dramatically
    expand lifespans in developed economies which will take 2-3
    generations to propagate to the entire world.
  - Reduce extreme poverty to less than 3%
  - Carbon Level will reach XXppm, temperature will reach xxC and
    the threshold will have long passed when sea level rise will be
    inevitable and over the next century submerge land where 40-60% of
    the world population live.
   

  - Automation will transform production, logistics and the nature of
    work -- industrial education will keep people back
  - Traditional economic stepping stones for nations and individuals
    to move up the economic ladder will largely go away

The final two changes will be thought by most people today as
impossible, just as the inevitibility of self-driving cars and
ubiquitious AI was even 10 years ago. The next two developments will
gradually become understood and accepted over the next 10-15 years.
Since the rate of change is still increasingly exponentially, the same
amount of change that took place in the past ten years will happen in
the next five, and so forth.  So changes that we intuitively /feel/
will take 50 years will take less than 15.

  - The foundations for industrialization of space will largely be in
    place and will begin to increase exponentially over the next fifty
    years -- so that 100 years from now heavy industry will be largely
    off planet and automated.  The cost of launching payloads into
    orbit will be equivilent to a long haul flight today.
    Construction of large mass-habitats will be well underway and it
    will be cheaper to move people up to a habitat than to move them
    to somewhere away from the coast and rising sealevels.
  - Lifespan will increase in developed countries far far higher than
    is projected.



  - Concentrate on 40%  

    - move 98% of the world to $10/day.
    - housing for $10 a day that can upgrade to $100/day.
    - education that will move children from 10->100 in a single
      generation.
    - jobs for everyone with an education & basic income for those who
      can not find or there are no jobs.
    - create special economic zones for existing favelas -- provide
      services, security, and materials to rebuild their homes as
      temporary staging area for moving up the ladder.
    - human scale jobs, housing and work

  - Cut carbon footprint & resource hogging in developed countries by
    two-thirds.  In large part this will be done by moving to
    renewables and to replace consumer lifestyles and manufacturing.

    - Fixable
    - Upgradable
    - Durable
    - Restructure Regulation from National to regional and local
    - Restrict Monopolies & Discourage Chains
    - Revamp Education -- lifelong, info literacy, civic responsibility
    - Architecture & construction: decommodify & build-as-you-grow
    - Rebalance rural & urban
