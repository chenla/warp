** Scope
Social infrastructure includes much of what States provide.
Some of it is private, but most of it is in the public
domain.

Social infrastructure include everything from the military,
police, education, prisons, fire fighting, search and rescue
and even diplomacy.

We are not including Healthcare Infrastructure here because
its scope is so large that it will be dealt with alone in
the next chapter.

Cultural infrastructure will have it's own chapter as well.
