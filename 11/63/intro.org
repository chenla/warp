** Scope
Much of infrastructure can be understood as types of systems made up
of stores and flows and regulated by negative feedback loops.
Infrastructure dynamically changes to meet the needs it is built for.
Over time infrastructure is abandoned, or dismantled, expanded,
upgraded or downsized. In many industrialized states, many railway
lines were abandoned, and at the beginning of this century, the global
network of "pay telephones" have largely been dismantled, and in
developing economies never built in the first place.
