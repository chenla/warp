** Scope
Most of the time, when people talk of infrastructure they mean
Material Infrastructure which includes roads, bridges, electrical
grids, phone networks, water and waste utilities, garbage pickup etc.
Material infrastructure includes flows and stores of Matter, Energy
and Information.

While we are here on earth we think of the atmosphere, which is a
mixture of gases within a range of atmopheric pressure to be a natural
resource.  However, as man begin to moves into space and throughout
the solar system, the atmosphere will be perhaps the single most
critical type of infrastructure.
