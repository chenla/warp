 - 00. As Commons
   - Private & Public
     Even when infrastructure is privately owned, if it is
     essential to maintaining civilization, States have
     always had the option of either nationalizing or
     privitizing. This provides a negative feedback loop.

     New Classes of Infrastructure nearly always begin in
     the private sector and eventually become public and are
     increasingly regulated as it becomes a critical part of
     civilization.
   - Nationalization & Privitization
     If private infrastructure goes off the rails (so to
     speak) is may be nationalized, reorganized and run as a
     public utility.  If State management becomes too
     inefficient or corrupt, infrastructure may then be
     privatized. Many examples.
   - Right of Way
   - Self-Owned
     In United States corporate law, a private incorporated
     company has nearly all the same rights as an
     individual.  This brings up the possibility of AI's
     being self-owned corporations with no human owners.
   
     A self-driving car not having an owner, but instead sells
     it's services to transport people and goods, and the
     revenue used go to fuel, repairs and saving to replace
     itself with a new vehicle.
