** TL;DR

Chenla is a series of projects and published works to
demonstrate a way for Mankind to build advanced distributed
and stable technological civilization from first
principles. Chenla is not proposing the design of any
specific civilization, rather, the goal is to provide a
generative framework for the present and future generations
to make any number of civilizations.  The history of human
civilization is iterative and bottom up, building on the
civilizations that came before them.  With each iteration we
learn a little more, and do a little better.  It is hoped
that these works will be of use in making that process a
little less random, a little more focused, and a lot less
disruptive and destructive as it has all too often been in
the past.

*** Warp & Woof

An introduction to the concepts used in *A Pace-Layer
Pattern Language* and *A Primer*

*A Pace-Layer Pattern Language* (APPL):

APPL is meant to expand on the world in Christopher
Alexander's A Pattern Language (APL) which was published in
1977 cite:alexander:1977pattern

Where APL focused on towns, cities and the architecture of
builds, the scope of APPL will be to encompass as aspects of
civilization and human existence.

In addition to /APL/-like Patterns, APPL will include the
following categories:

  - Patterns :: Archetypal Design Patterns for structures,
                settlements, social organization and systems. 
  - Parameters :: Constants and Variables.
  - Theses :: Assertions that may be moral or ethical but
              may not be justified purely on logical or
              evidence-based grounds. 
  - Keystones :: Key Reference Designs and Specifications.

Another departure from APL will be that APPL will be what is
called a /literate program/ which combines text together
with computer software code.  The code is executed when the
pattern is generated.  This makes it possible for patterns
to be machine understandable.  This will be important in the
next work in the series, /The Hoard/ which will is a 
group of /generative grammars/ which are expressed as both a
text narrative and code.

APPL will establish the broad patterns that can be used to
construct generative grammars that will be adapted to
account for local context (conditions) in the /Hoard/.

*** Hoard 

A hoard is a collection of treasured goods and information.
In Old English, the word for dictionary was a /worde hord/.

It is a combination repository under version control that
contains the source code for generating Primers.  In a
Platonic sense, APPL is the world of archetypes and the
Hoard are the shadows on the wall that we can see and
interact with. The APPL is a way of thinking globally, and a
hoard pragmatically thinks and acts locally.

Hoards are organized using two different models, the
/Pace-Layer/ model, and a /Succession-Stage/ model.

As in the previous two works, the Hoard is not a
prescriptive design for civilization.  Rather it is meant to
create generate grammars that can be used to create very
long term civilizations from first principles that are 
distributed /and/ antifragile.

A Hoard includes plans, designs, standards, specifications
based on /keystone/ reference designs and patterns from the
APPL which are adapted for a range specific needs of a
ecological, economic, technological, and cultural niches of
any given civilization.

*** Primer

A Primer is a collection of prescriptive and descriptive
knowledge needed to build a specific civilization.

In many cases the only way to develop a keystone reference
design is by building a number of designs for specific
needs.  So in order for us to come up with many of the
patterns, generative grammars and keystone designs, we will
start with specific designs, identify what makes it work and
what can be used as a universal principle and then work
backwards.  The Primer will include all of this specific
design and development work that was done to develop
patterns and keystone designs.

*** Arc

The Archive, or Arc for short, is collection of digital
data, texts, images, audio video, 2D and 3D vector graphics
and code that represents the a subset of Mankind's recorded
memory and experience that provides the context and
background needed to build and maintain a civilization.
