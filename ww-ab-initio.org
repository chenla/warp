** Civilization from First Principles

Decartes from the preface to the Principles of Philosophy (1644):

#+begin_quote
I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what
philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for
example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and
that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the
management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can
know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of
his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to
subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so
that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called
[284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of
those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles
must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear
and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them,
cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of
other things must be so dependent on them as that though the
principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on
them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the
former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to
deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend
on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of
deductions which is not perfectly manifest.
