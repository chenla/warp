Social psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt assert that two
fundamental features are present in all cases of awe: perceived
vastness and accommodation.  Vastness applies obviously to such things
as the immensity of the scale of the universe, a central interest of
Big History, but also to anything that appears larger than the self,
or the self ’s ordinary frame of reference. This includes unequal
social status, such as awe of royalty and fame, seen today in our cult
of celebrity. The second characteristic of awe identified by Keltner
and Haidt, accommodation, refers to the necessity created by “an
inability to assimilate an experience into current mental structures.

#+begin_quote
Job’s direct challenge regarding God’s existence and ethical
intentions is thus met with an indirect response, wherein the deity
goes on at length about how little humans know of anything. Fragile,
limited creatures that they are, how can they possibly understand the
ways of God?  he demands. And given their ignorance, what right do
they have to use such words as undeserved and unmerited? There are
untold things about the galaxy that mankind cannot properly interpret
and upon which, therefore, it ought not presume to impose its flawed
logic. Human beings did not bring the cosmos into being and, despite
their occasional feelings to the contrary, they do not control or own
it. God tries to shake Job out of his preoccupation with the events in
his own life by drawing his attention to the immensity and variety of
nature. He evokes a sweeping vision of the totality of existence, from
the foundation of the earth to the tracks of the constellations, from
the heights attained by a hawk in flight to the labour pains of a
mountain goat, in the hope of instilling in the man from Uz a
redeeming sense of awe.

The strategy works: Job is reminded of the scale of all that surpasses
him and of the age, size and mystery of space. God’s whirlwind, and
the sonorous, sublime words he speaks, excite a pleasing terror in his
audience, a sense of how petty are man’s disasters in comparison with
the ways of eternity, leaving Job – and the rest of us, perhaps – a
little readier to bow to the incomprehensible and morally obscure
tragedies that every life entails.
