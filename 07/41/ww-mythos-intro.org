** Scope

Mythos is the cornerstone of human cognition, communication and social
systems.  Myth at it's core begins with an origin story, and from
there expands out to provide a narrative framework for people to
understand and navigate the world around them.  Myths change over time
to reflect not only how people see and experience the world, but also
what they are capable of understanding.  Big History is the
cornerstone for a cultural mythos for a technologically advanced
civilization, but it wouldn't be appropriate for cultures at earlier
succession stages.

For this reason, we need to match myth with the developmental stage
that people are in.  This doesn't mean that people at earlier stages
are /savages/ or stupid, they are every bit as intelligent as we are
today, and in some respect their understanding of their place in
nature was more advanced than ours today.  Mythos is inherently lossy,
it is a map of a territory that has big gaps in it.  The smaller the
gaps, the more fine-grained a worldview and more nuanced and abstract
the cultural mythos is to understand it.

Religions and even governance are both based on cultural mythos of
their time.  As JRR Tolkien understood, you can't build a spoken or
written language without an underlying mythology.

Mythos is a progressive living narrative that not only seeks to
explain, but provides means for us to cope with the world.  Technology
extends and externalizes our ability to cope and manipulate the world
and with the development of cognitive machines it provides an ideal
fondation for building an universal interface that can be used by
anyone, anywhere in the world at any stage of development by mapping
any cultural mythos as a skin on top of this interface.

The 3rd of Clarke's three laws states: "Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic."cite:clarke:1984profiles
Technology has long now surpassed the ability for most non-specialists
to understand.  A large number of people today have no idea how most
of the technology they use every day works.  Ask the average person
how an air conditioner works and you'll get a shrug.  People largely
use technology, they don't understand it.  And today we are still in
the early stages of the tecnhological revolution.  For most people,
using Siri on an iPhone is functionally equivilent to magic.  So
employing the foundational framework for undestanding the world, our
cultural mythos as a a technological interface is the most natural
approach to take.

** TL;DR

What is the relationship between mythos and origin story?

Is origin at the bottom of the mythos stack?

Are they separate?  Religions bundle them together -- but maybe
they should be separate.

We use Big History as a meta-origin narrative which is too
universal and big for most people to use in their day to day
lives.  Big History is a bit like the monothesistic scalable
dieties where god get's pushed farther and farther away the
larger it becomes.  This takes aways a core function of
relgion and myth -- that it not only gives us context for
navigating the world, but it gives us agency in that world.

We need both -- a big sweeping meta story that everyone
shares -- our eternal blue sky narrative.  And then we need
to make that narrative local -- that's what the oldest
religious systems had -- very local gods, many times
specific to a very small group or place.  These gods are
part and parcel with the world that you are in contact with
every day.  And because they are so local, you have a
personal relationship with them that is not possible with
the ultimate monothesistic systems which are too
generalized, which leads to local interpretation that
creates the context that people need.  But that threatens to
fragment the meta-religious narrative.  Why not just keep
them apart, all locales are under the same sky.  I'm not
threatened by your gods because they are over there in your
context, and I have mine here in front of me in the shrine
in my room.

I see this here in Cambodia and Thailand.  You have Buddha
who provides the meta narrative, but most of the time you
spend tending the smaller dieties, the house gods, door gods
and the occasional tree spirit living in the ancient banyon
tree in your village.  The Catholics have their Saints who
provide the same function.  There is also ancestor worship,
which literally are your dead relatives who can pull some
strings on your behalf in the spirit world so long as you
take care of them in this world.
