** TL;DR

In /Seeing Like A State/ cite:scott:1998seeing James Scott
defines legibility as the need for states to be able to
reliably identify and keep accounts of their subjects, or
citizens, who they are and where they are.  What property
(in terms of land) they may inhabit or own (if freehold land
ownership it allowed) and how much wealth they produce.
Land is surveyed to create claudastral maps indicating the
boundries of parcels of land, what type of land it is, and
who is liable for that land.  All of this is done for three
reasons, collecting taxes, conscription (raising armies) and
stopping attempts of anyone who tries to wrest power from
those who are in power.

He makes the case that historically it's been in the
interest of most people to not be legible if possible
because the less legible you are to the state, the more
control over you they have, and the more wealth or even life
they can extract from you.

Legibility is a process of standardization and simplication,
that reduces the complexity of making persons and property
legible.  This standardization comes in many forms, from
using standard weights and measures, to forcing people to
adopt legal names, and family names that are easier to keep
track of.

In addition to standardization and simplication for the
state, it was quickly adapted by financial institutions for
keeping track of parties involved in financial
transactions.  For businesses it made it easier to keep
inventories and reduce theft and corruption from employees.

It could also be used to keep whole States accountable to
it's citizens.

Over time, as more and more different types of metrics were
maintained about more types of goods, processes and
transactions, the information that makes something legible
became increasingly abstract and is now lumped together
under the term metadata, or data that describes data.  Or in
traditional terms, data that describes people and things and
what they do.

When there is enough metadata, it becomes big data, and big
data is valuable in it's own right as an indicator of the
behavior and future actions of processes and people.
