** Scope

An economy cuts a pretty broad swath of a civilization:

#+begin_quote
An economy is an area of the production, distribution, or trade, and
consumption of goods and services by different agents. Understood in
its broadest sense, 'The economy is defined as a social domain that
emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions
associated with the production, use, and management of resources.

....

A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its
culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social
organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its
geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main
factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions
and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the
economic domain is a social domain of human practices and
transactions. It does not stand alone.

#+end_quote

Different kinds of economies achieve this in different ways.  Market
economies use barter or a medium of exchange (money) to achieve this
according to supply and demand.  The assumption is, that if there is a
need for something, someone will find a way of filling that need
through production of goods and services.  All in all this system is
messy and leaves a great deal of room for abuse, but is better than
the alternatives because it is at base, a bottom up approach where the
purpose of production is to meet needs.  In a command-based an
authority (usually political) controls how things are produced and
distributed.  Because of the complexity of even fairly small
economies, it is for all all intents and purposes impossible to
anticipate needs, plan production and coordinate distribution anywhere
close to as well as market-based economies can do.  This doesn't mean
that market-economies are perfect, far from it, but to date it's
better than the alternatives that have been tried.  Market-eonomies
which are regulated to ensure that the markets are both free and fair
minimize the worst in market-economies which quickly go off the rails
if there is not substantive regulation.  Unregulated market-economies
are called free-markets, and they are as bad and in some ways worse
than command-economies.  This has not stopped many people believing
that free-economies supply and demand is a self-regulating system, and
that if all regulation was removed it would result in a capitalist
self-regulating utopia.  What they forget is that at the beginning of
the industrial revolution mass production created just this kind of
self-regulated system and it resulted in truly horrible behavior.

Unfortunately, economies today assume that anything bartered or traded
must be either goods or services.  All goods are a form of property
which has an owner.  The word property also means land, which under
the present system also has an owner, even if that owner is a diety.

Services, on the other hand, treat work-done on behalf of someone else
as a kind of property as well.  Work is energy expended to do
something.  Services are usually measured in increments of time, and
the value of a service is determined by how easy or difficult the work
done is.

The problem with this system is that it doesn't account for
information, which until a few decades ago could only be used as
physical goods that stored information, such as a book, musical
recording or video tape.  Information could also be treated as a
service in the form of transmission information, or in the form of a
performance such as a concert.

The digital revolution made it possible for the cost of storing and
transmitting information so cheap that for all practical purposes it
became free.  Treating information as either goods or services was
not a very good fit.  So, the concept of copyright and design patents
were invented to treate specific arrangements of information as
property in their own right.  This worked well when physical
recordings the norm because you weren't selling information, just an
object whose value came from the information recorded on the object.

When all of these objects were replaced by digitized information
transmitted essentially for free over the Internet there was no way to
monetize information beause transmission of information makes no
distinction of what is being transmitted.  Transission works fine as a
service, but without physical objects to sell, the producers of
information no longer had means of earning a living from it.

Copyright literally means the right to copy, but that was when what
was copied was a physical object which is property with an owner.  If
you take away my copy of physical object then I no longer have that
object, that object as wealth has been taken or transfered to a
different owner.  But digital copies that are not permanent physical
objects can be copied and transmitted for free without depriving the
person the copy was made from of their copy.  Ownership is a zero-sum
process that tranfers one thing from one owner to another.  If
something is not a zero-sum transfer, then it no longer functions as
property.  So the concept of copyright changed to mean that the person
who owned the original copy also effectively owned all copies made of
it, whether they were physical or not.  This has not worked out very
well.  But it also has thrown a very large and growing part of the
concept of property and market-economies out of wack.
