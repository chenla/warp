*horcrux as fork* of an identity stack, including all roles
-- but each horcrux is not simply a copy but an agent in its
own right -- that's what makes it a Horcrux.  But the thing
is, what what was never explained in Harry Potter, was the
mechanism for how different horcruxes, which each possess
agency, synced with each other and merged Î”'s.  This is a
distributed system.

 - identity    (con)
   - fork      (exp)
     - role    (man)
       - agent (in) 

*horcrux as shard* of a specific role and not the entire
identity stack.

 - identity      (con)
   - role        (exp)
     - agent     (man) 
       - shard   (in)

You fork an identity and shard an agent.

Once you understand identity as a distributed version control
system, it all makes sense.
