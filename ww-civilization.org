** TL;DR

Civilization -> comes from the word civitis meaning city.
The ancient greeks used the word polis to mean city, but it
was also the closest thing they had to the concept of
civilization.  This is a good place to start -- and grounds
us at human scales.

      as much a part of civilization as anything else.
      Pretty much everything written about civilization only
      talks about ecosystems in terms of resources -- as if
      resources were external to the system.  A civilization
      in the middle of an Ice Age will be very different
      from a civilization during an era with a clement
      climate.  It is not enough to only talk in terms of
      carrying capacity, but also climate patterns,
      biodiversity, how difficult or easy is it to extract
      raw materials from the lithosphere.

** Getting up to speed

We are not starting with an origin story -- that doesn't
belong here and will have it's place at several layers of
abstraction in our story.  But in order to understand how to
build a civilization from first principles we need to
understand how the evolution of specialization, scale and
technology have gotten us from being hunter gatherers ten
thousand years ago, to where we are today.  We don't have to
go into too much detail here but we need a broad outline of
how it all happened so we know how we got here, where we are
now and where we are going.

Getting up to Date:

   - Before the enlightenment the big shift was first
     development of spoken language.  But memory was still
     RAM, that only existed in living memory.  But this was
     enough to create permanent settlements, agriculture and
     scale communities that made it possible to increase the
     complexity of human societies by several orders of
     magnitude.  This was the beginning of the concept of
     property, and extending that concept from land, to
     material goods and to other people.  The slave era was
     a paradox, subjecting most people to wretched lives
     where the wealth they created propagated to an elite
     few, and did not improve the lives of those creating
     the wealth.  But it also created surpluses that
     extended the elite to a new class of people people
     whose only job was to think, solve problems and come up
     with new ideas.  But this was an oral tradition, the
     surplus's had a ceiling which was essentially that of
     the memory of individual humans -- this was the world
     of Homer.

   - Those surpluses allowed people to solve the memory
     problem by inventing written language -- which extended
     human cognition, externalized human memory and made it
     possible to communicate to places that the author had
     never been and into the future.  This triggered a
     cognitive revolution that was not to be matched until
     the industrial revolution -- The industrial revolution
     began earlier than many thought, and a number of
     keystone inventions laid the groundwork for it over
     several centuries -- including the printing press, the
     concept of external power sources such as wind and
     water (not as propulsive power, but to power tools,
     laying the groundwork for machines).  Other keystone
     inventions included standardization of measures, time
     measurement, the printing press, etc.

   - The steam revolution was at the heart of the industrial
     revolution -- 

     steam was crude and wasteful, which was replaced by the
     internal combustion engine which bypassed steam and
     moved fire directly into the engine.

   - The electric revolution vastly reduced the number of
     moving parts and replaced fire completely and was far
     more flexible.

   - electricity made machines very large and very small --
     which meant that muscle was not only replaced at very
     large scales, but human scales with machines at human
     scales and machines that worked at scales far smaller
     than human scales -- this which made possible the first
     cognitive machines.  It not only created machine
     cognition, but machine memory -- memory that could be
     used to think internally within cognitive machines.

----------------

   - a few pockets of civilization, in ancient Greece, India and
     China laid the initial groundwork that solidified
     mankind's transition from spoken language to be able
     to externalize and extend mind and memory using
     written language.
     - scientific revolution kicked it off
     - based on rationality, science, and progress (Pinker's def)
     - Bacon, Decartes, Locke and Spinoza
     - place in the universe
       - the Copernican revolution -> we are not at the center
       - the Darwinian revolution -> we are not apart from nature
   - mechanization extended the hand using tools, to
     machines leveraging hand and muscle.  This
     fundamentally transformed man from beasts of burden
     controlled by an elite, to thinking slaves operating
     machines -- machines replaces human muscle.


   - combined with Industrial Revolution, began, in 1800 a
     transformation in human existence.
     - war, violence, poverty, education, human rights
       etc. all began a massive upwards curve that we are
       still in the middle of.


** Human Civilization in a Nutshell

This is not an origin story -- that's moved to the primer.

However it's useful to have a synopsis of human history that
will provide context for the work:


Humans don't scale, we are pre-programed to live in packs (bands) which are
spaced far enough apart to not compete with each other.  The closer these
groups get to each other the more competition and violence between them.

When Man became sedentary, and settlements were established too close to
each other that they competed for resources, conflict was inevitable and
10,000 years pretty much unending warefare ensued.

Small settlements found that if they merged (by one conquering another) the
larger settlement had an edge the smaller ones.  But humans are not good at
living together in sizes larger than a band, so hierarchies were
established which placed a few people at the top, controlling all of the
land in the settlement and any wealth created, and the rest under them,
were treated as property themselves with any wealth they created
auto-propagating to those at the top.  This was the beginning of slavery.

If each band is a petri dish, and two petri dishes come into contact with
each other, one will win and other other loose and the resources of the
looser become part of the winner's petri dish.

But a curious thing happened.  The surpluses controlled by the few at the
top gave them free time to think and spend time doing things that were not
directly related to survival.  The larger a settlement became the more
specializations were required to maintain it.  So just below the elite at
the top another small group emerged who were given enough wealth to do
nothing but think and come up with ideas and solve problems.  This could
not have happened without slavery.

Slavery, in it's most basic form, treats people as draft animals that can
think.  But not think too much because they are too busy doing physical
labor with little more than hand tools.  All institutional slavery is based
on hard physical labor using human muscle.

When machines evolved from tools with power sources that did not depend on
human muscle, the old slavery model didn't work any longer.  You needed
people with minimal education literacy and numerancy to be able to operate
the machines.  So slavery was quickly replaced with employees who had
minimum education and had been conditioned to do what they were told and
stay in one place for very long hours and do the same task over and over.
These workers didn't have to be treated as property, they did more than
slaves did, and didn't run away because they had the illusion of being
free, when for all practical purposes they had no choice but work as an
industrial slave, or work in the fields far harder in the countryside.  The
factory was a better life than subsistence farming.  Everything was
standardized so workers and machines were interchangeable so iif a worker
ran away, there was no shortage of people from the countryside to replace
them.

Machines transformed slavery and gave the slaves a better life, though they
were still effectively slaves.  But because of the man-machine duo, each
person could produce vastly more wealth than before.  This made it possible
to increase the size of the intellectual class who think and solve
problems, this unleashed the beginning of an age of innovation and
discovery that is growing exponentially.  The more problems solved, the
better the lives of the slaves have become.

The next thing that happened was almost as strange.  Production had become
so efficient that it outstripped need.  It soon became obvious to the
elites that their slaves were the best market for all of this extra
production capacity -- so slaves were conditioned to buy not just what they
needed, but what they desired.  This kept them happy slaves and created
even more wealth for the elite and increased the thinking class even more.

This created the conditions for making most wars and violence something
that hurt the elites instead of increasing their wealth.  If everyone
agreed not to kill each other everyone could accrue far more wealth and the
slaves could increase their wealth a bit more and expect that their
position would increase, slowly, but would improve so long as they played
the game and agreed to stay slaves.

This brings us up to where we were about 20 years ago.  But things are set
to change again as dramatically as they did when slaves became workers.

First, all of the petri dishes have effectively become one -- we're run out
of desirable territory to populate.   So we've created a nation state
system which is effectively frozen for the time being.

Next we learned to communicate at very long distances at speeds which
effectively makes the entire planet from the perspective of communication
and news propagation the same as if everything was living next door to each
other,

Next we have learned to make machines think -- not think as well as us
(yet) but they can think well enough to control machines and decrease the
number of people needed to operate machines.
This is happening so fast, and machines are learning to think better and
better that it's likely in a few decades that most machines will not
require people to operate them.  In other words, a hell of a lot of slaves
(billions of them) will be out of the slave business.  But they will still
be in the consumption business.  Without anyone to consumer what is
produced, there is no reason to produce it.  So we'll take the surplus
wealth created by thinking machines operating our machines that create
wealth and give that wealth to the former slaves and most of the wealth
will still go to the elites.
