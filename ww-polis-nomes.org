** TL;DR

We define here the broad outlines of what an ideal Polis is as a legal,
physical, and social entity according to first principles.


#+begin_quote
If we turn back in history we find, however, that, throughout the long
evolution of human settlements, people in all parts of the world
tended to build an urban settlement which reached an optimum size of
50,000 people and physical dimensions such that everyone was within a
10-minute distance from the center. There is no question that, for
people who depend on walking as a means of locomotion, this unit is
the optimum one from th e point of view of movement and social
interaction through direct contacts between people.  Also, experience
has shown that, for people who can walk, it is a maximum one from the
standpoint of aesthetics; for example, creation of the Place de la
Concorde in Paris cut from the total 3500-meter length of the Champs
Elysees a length of 2100 meters, a distance from which one can reach,
and enjoy, the Arc de Triomphe on foot. It is also perhaps an optimum
one from the social point of view; for example, Pericles in ancient
Athens could get a reasonable sample of public opinion by meet ing 100
to 150 people while walking from his home to the Assembly.
