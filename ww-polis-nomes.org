** TL;DR

#+begin_comment
So how much of this, if any, should be in w&w and how much
in APPL?  The thing is, there are lot of things in the TOC
do not belong in the patterns -- I want to show the whole
heirarchy from person to federation and how that fits
together -- and the points that tie them together and then
the specifics be put into the patterns...

The cool thing for me as I write this is that this is the
level at which we drill down into w&w where we begin to make
the cross-over into APPL.  At this level, about three levels
down from the top, where the distinction gets blurry.

w&w should show in the how patterns form larger abstract
patterns on this side, but then on the other side of APPL
you'll see the same abstract pattern in the Primer which
outlines the reference specifications and the nuts and bolts
of how it fits together and works, but in that case it will
be a manifestation, where it will be an instance in the
hoard.  The hoard, remember, is the information and running
code for a specific instance of a civilization.

** Urban Population Range

We define here the broad outlines of what an ideal Polis is
as a legal, physical, and social entity according to first
principles.

#+begin_quote
If we turn back in history we find, however, that,
throughout the long evolution of human settlements, people
in all parts of the world tended to build an urban
settlement which reached an optimum size of 50,000 people
and physical dimensions such that everyone was within a
10-minute distance from the center. There is no question
that, for people who depend on walking as a means of
locomotion, this unit is the optimum one from th e point of
view of movement and social interaction through direct
contacts between people.  Also, experience has shown that,
for people who can walk, it is a maximum one from the
standpoint of aesthetics; for example, creation of the Place
de la Concorde in Paris cut from the total 3500-meter length
of the Champs Elysees a length of 2100 meters, a distance
from which one can reach, and enjoy, the Arc de Triomphe on
foot. It is also perhaps an optimum one from the social
point of view; for example, Pericles in ancient Athens could
get a reasonable sample of public opinion by meet ing 100 to
150 people while walking from his home to the Assembly.
