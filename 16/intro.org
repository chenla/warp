** Scope

The three branches of civilization providing checks and
balances on each other.

MIDDLE   runs things on a day to day basis
CULTURE  is largely in the background, has great power but
         thinks and acts very slowly - it saves, safeguards 
         and maintains the hoard.  
SCOPE    very strong and works in real time, but has a 
         very short leash -- it is an interface with
         everything outside

It's important that just because we are suggesting that civilization
adopt a negative feedback loop mechanism that is typically associated
with goverance of nation states they are not the same thing.

Since civilization is a system, negative feedback loops are needed to
maintain a stable system from going too far out of balance.

The idea of separating a civilization into different branches that
provide negative feedback loops is a natural fit.  But they are not
the same as a branch of government though they will overlap and
sometimes appear to be the same thing.

In a distributed nested and federated network governance takes place
at many different layers.  So long as the system is designed that all
local governance, from that within a family or shop, up to governance
of a polis/nomes and regional and even global bodies then governance
will always take place as close to where it is needed.

So the three branches are not so much defined by articles of
governance but rather as broad categories of functions within a
culture that maintain negative feedback loops.  For this to work
everyone has to agree that each branch has a function and can be told
what to do by the other branches when things get out of wack.

This would likely not be possible without machine-cogs automating and
managing things according to rulesets that we create for them to
follow.  It's difficult to articulate the difference between gov
branches and civilization branches because they need to function more
as ecological negative feedback loops than top-down composed
organizational human negative feedback mechanisms.  Branches are
simply codified expressions and manifestations of pace-layers, or put
another way, pace-layers as slow-AIs with a higher degree of agency
than our paper-based rulesets that constitute governmental systems.
