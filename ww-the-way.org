** TL;DR

Build iteratively bottom up, understand and manage top down.

No beginning or end, start anywhere, create infrastructure
between nodes and grow until everything is connected.


** Table of Contents

  - Succession- pioneer stage
      - sparse nodes, like early Internet
      - dummy nodes
      - surrogate nodes
    - intermediate stages
    - mature stage
  - Specialization  niche
  - Plan - development
    - identify problem or need 
    - imagine solution form hypothesis
    - collect patterns
    - form language
    - identify inputs, side effects and desired outputs
    - end of life, and recycling/repurposing as input to
      other niches and processes
    - process start and end points
    - break into steps
    - feedback mechanisms
    - rules and process logic
  - Build
    - build model, test scenarios
    - build prototype - alpha
    - build beta and try in production
    - build release candidate put into production
  - Deploy
    - collect feedback, fix bugs
    - identify new features
    - loop add features, test, release 
    - when something breaks roll back
    - monitor feedback for maintain and management --
      anticipate failures
  - Production 
    - when stable, replicate while developing new features and fixes
