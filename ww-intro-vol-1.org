** TL;DR

The first volume lays out the broad foundation for the work,
what is civilization, how did it emerge, what forms has it
taken throughout history, what are the driving forces behind
it.  This lays the groundwork for understanding different
ways that civilization might work in a technologically
advanced post-scarcity future that we are starting to see
the beginnings of today which we will get into in detail in
Volume III.

Then what do we mean by first principles? In a word, it is
what Paul Graham called, when describing the design of the
programming laguage Arc,  "no onions in the varnish":

#+begin_quote
In /The Periodic Table/, Primo Levi tells a story that
happened when he was working in a varnish factory. He was a
chemist, and he was fascinated by the fact that the varnish
recipe included a raw onion. What could it be for? No one
knew; it was just part of the recipe. So he investigated,
and eventually discovered that they had started throwing the
onion in years ago to test the temperature of the varnish:
if it was hot enough, the onion would fry.

We're going to try not to include any onions in Arc.
