** TL;DR

#+begin_comment
What are pattern languages -- how they work, how to make
them, how to use them.

Need a chapter on what patterns are NOT.  Many of the
pattern languages and there are a lot of them, do not seem
to understand that patterns are not simply another
methodology you use in software or construction projects,
they are meant to reveal sets of complex relationships which
defy description.  They work on a nonverbal level as much as
the verbal, they are not classification systems.  Patterns
are only useful if those patterns have been woven into your
brain, you have to master them through conscious practice,
experiment and contemplation.  If you don't they are just
another checklist of attributes or features to add to a
design or project.  Patterns are not snap together modular
Lego Bricks.  When they have been used that way people
wonder why they don't work.
