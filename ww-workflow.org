** TL;DR

There is workflow for a person, for a group and for system
processes.  The last may sound strange but I think this is
the right way of thinking about it.

If a Pattern Language is a concept and a Primer is a expression
then the hoard is an instance.

The Primer is the DNA, and the Hoard is the translation of
the DNA by RNA into proteins that actually build stuff.
