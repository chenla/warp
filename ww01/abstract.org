** Scope



** TL;DR

Our objective here is positivist but not as part of any specific
scientific paradigm.  Rather, this is an attempt at building a
consistent general model of the world that is consistent with
evidence, thought and discourse across the sciences, arts, crafts and
cultures. Our purpose is to create a common inclusive model or
worldview that provides a framework for Mankind, as individuals,
societies and the civilzation we are building and live our lives in.

We start with first facts and build from first principles the best we
can; obviate what separates us from ourselves, each other and clouds
the mind and eye.  We Sapiens are but one species in a vast continuum
of life spanning billions of years and trillions of species ranging
in size from the smallest bacteria to the great blue whale, the
largest animal known to have lived on this planet.  There is no clear
demarcation of where one species begins and another ends.  As much as
a third of each human is made up of a kaleidoscopic zoo of
microorganisms that are separate creatures in their own right.
We carry mitocondrian genomes which are interconnected with but
separate from our own genomes.
