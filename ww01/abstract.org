** Scope



** TL;DR

Our objective here is positivist but not as part of any specific
scientific paradigm.  Rather, this is an attempt at building a
consistent general model of the world that is consistent with
evidence, thought and discourse across the sciences, arts, crafts and
cultures. Our purpose is to create a common inclusive framework for
Mankind, as individuals, societies and the constantly evolving
civilzation we live our lives in.

We start with first facts and build from first principles the best we
can; obviate what separates us from ourselves, each other and clouds
the mind and eye.  We Sapiens are but one species in a vast continuum
of life spanning billions of years and trillions of species ranging in
size from the micro to megascopic.

For this to work, this is a necessarily loose, yet antifragile,
conceptional framework that is resistent to being frozen into dogma
and ideological roach motels.  Owning up to our ignorance also means
being honest enough to admit that even our most cherished beliefs
about the world must be challenged and periodically overturned without
threatening our identity, dignity and moral compass. We live but an
exceedingly brief time and will be dead forever after. To live is to
change and we must embrace and celebrate that change and work to
ensure that change leads to a larger and better world for ourselves
and those who come after us.
