** Scope

The problem of where to begin is ... vexing.  Arbitrary
beginnings are subject to where you happen to be relative to
what you might be looking at.  Beginnings are never
absolute.  Something can always be added or subtracted from
any given set.  I've always found that comforting.  Human's
can't grasp infinities.  We loose grip, and are lost in
things without end.  We do know madness all to well.  Deep
down we know our limits, limits of knowing, limits of
seeing, limits of feeling when we stray too far from the
narrow path of human scale.

Best thing is to start with what is known while knowing we
are stepping into a river that can never be stepped in
twice.  So define variables and constants and set them as
first facts, ever mindful that we won't all agree on some,
and that in time, many others will be replaced by those who
see further than ourselves.

Now wipe the slate clean, collect these, our first facts,
and starting from first principles frame a narrative of who
and where we are, where and when we came from, our strengths
and weaknesses and how to go about setting the cornerstones
for a civilization that will serve Mankind's needs for the
next century and beyond.

** TL;DR

Our objectives are positivist, but not as part & parcel of
any one paradigm, discipline or tradition.  Rather, this is
an attempt at building a consistent general model of the
world that is consistent with evidence, thought and
discourse across the sciences, arts, crafts and
cultures. Our purpose is to create a common inclusive
framework for Mankind, as individuals, societies and the
constantly evolving civilzation we live our lives in.

We start with first facts and build from first principles
the best we can; obviate what separates us from ourselves,
each other and clouds the mind and senses.  We Sapiens are
but one species in a vast continuum of life spanning
billions of years and trillions of species ranging in size
from the micro to megascopic living in a shared biosphere.

The strong force ... the weak force ... gravity gives us
place to stand with an an up and down and keeps things from
flying apart and at the right distence from the sun to keep
water liquid, an atmosphere thick enough to sheild us from
being cooked by cosmic and solar radiation and light enough
for photosynthesis and to navigate using a narrow band of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

We are not /one with nature/.  As Sagan said, we are
stardust, every atom of every one of us, a subset of time,
space, matter and energy, not outside, not apart. The ghost
and the machine are but tiny motes of complexity in the
vastness of the heavens our ancestors saw in the broad swath
of the Milky Way on clear starry nights amid the cacophanic
nocturn of insects and creatures about their business in the
darkness.

For this to work, our common narrative must necessarily be
loose, yet spun from the toughest fibers into threads that
become stronger over time ra, conceptional framework that is
resistent to being frozen into dogma and ideological roach
motels.  Owning up to our ignorance also means being honest
enough to admit that even our most cherished beliefs about
the world must be challenged and periodically overturned
without threatening our identity, dignity and moral
compass. We live but an exceedingly brief time and dead
forever after. That times needs to count.  Life as is any
dynamic complex system is by definition in motion, in the
process of becoming something else.  We embrace and
celebrate that process and work to ensure /that/ change
leads to a larger and better world for ourselves and those
who come after us.
