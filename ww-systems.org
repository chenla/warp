** TL;DR

A civilization is a human system so we must first and
foremost understand civilizations using systems thinking, or
systems theory.  It's important to understand that
civilization is not an isolated system, it is simply a layer
that acts as a separate system which is part of local
ecological, global biospheric system which includes hydro and
atmospheric systems build on top of a lithosphere (literally
rock) which is the physical planet, as well the the
heliospheric system (the sun) which which is at the heart of
the solar-system.  The solar system is, in turn part of a
galactic system which on geological timescales directly
impact life on our planet as our sun orbits the galaxy and
at different times is closer or further proximity to other
stellar systems, radiation, gas and matter that our star
passes through.  When our sun has a close brush with another
star, the Oort Clouds of both systems will pass through each
other and we will exchange asteriods, some of which will
become comets.  This has happened many times in the history
of our solar system though we have no idea how many times or
how it has effected us.  The more we can examine objects
from the Oort cloud the more we will learn about these
things.  There is even the possibility that life on earth,
which has been trapped in the ice of a comet could have been
captured by a passing star and seeding life to other solar
systems.  And obviously the reverse could be true as well
and life on earth could have first evolved in another system
that infected us!

how we divide things and increase complexity

*** Systems

systems are made up of different components that are filled
by specialized sub-processes.  The larger the system, the
more it tends to become more complex, by larger processess
to become finer-grained in order to adapt to variations in
the larger territory/population.

A sub process could be a plant or animal in an ecosystem, or
it could be a specialization in a society/civilization.

*** Specializations

Several things happen to specialists -- first, the domain of
a specialist process is called a niche.  If the specialist
that fills that niche dies or the parameters for that niche
change so that the specialist no longer has the ability to
fulfill the needs of that process you get an empty niche
which eventually is filled by a new specialist that evolves
to fill that niche.

when two ecosystems come into contact and effectively merge,
and there are now two different specialists that fill the
same niche, over time, one of the two specialists is found
to be better than the other and takes over that niche.  We
see this over and over in natural history and in societies.

** Table of Contents
 - Cybernetics 

 - Systems Thinking
   - Relationships between different parts of a system
   - flows of energy and resources, needs and opportunities

   - processes that can be thought of as a series of steps
     in which the result of one event triggers another event
     etc.  In computer science this is called Input and
     Output.  Input introduces something into a process that
     does something with the input and the output is then
     fed into another process which does does something that
     produces an output until the process is complete, or
     loops back to start again.  If there is a loop, a
     feedback system is then required to determine if or
     when a loop is terminated.

   - positive feedback loops reinforce unchecked growth

   - negative feedback loops have upper and lower boundries
     and a trigger (sensor) that trips if growth should
     start or stop in order to remain within those
     boundries.


 - positive vs negative space
   - in architecture 
     -- negative is what surrounds what is built
     -- positive is what is built
     -- we move through negative spaces
     -- we dwell in positive spaces
   - in ecology
     -- negative is where there are no resources 
     -- positive is where resources are distributed
     -- species fill ecological niches through adaptation to
        dynamics of the niche, climate, how to access
        resources, shelter, countermeasures against
        predators etc.
   - in cooperative social systems
     -- positive is created by breaking up knowledge and
        tasks into sizes that an individual can handle.  The
        more complex the task, the more knowledge and skills
        required to complete the task.  As systems scales,
        the need for a task is larger than a single person
        can fill, so the task is duplicated so that more than
        one person is filling the same task.
     -- negative is created between knowledge and skill
        domains which require different skills,  tools
        resources and knowledge.
   - in market economies
     -- negative is where there are no needs or opportunities
     -- positive is where there are opportunities to fill
        needs
     -- people develop methods to fill needs to survive
        where there is less competition, if the people
        filling a need outnumber the demand for the need
        then the cost (reward) goes down through competition
     -- markets are a flexible means of distributing
        specialization because they don't require
        hierarchical coordination -- planned economies fail
        because of top-down command and control which is not
        flexible enough to meet the needs of unpredictible
        complexity.

  - Specializations & niches
    - the larger the territory of a system, the higher the
      number of specializations -- this is because as things
      scale more variations are introduced between the
      different specializations that fill niches (needs) in
      a system so the system adapts by creating variations
      that specialize in meeting the needs in local
      variations.
    - when two systems come into contact with each other,
      the more interaction between the two systems (the less
      that each system is isolated from each other) the
      tendency if for the to systems to merge into a single
      homogeneous system.
    - when systems merge, specializations that fill the same
      niche in the previous separate systems begin to
      compete  for the same niche.  The speialization that
      is better adapted to fill the combined niches will
      tend replace the other specialization.
