** TL;DR

A tool is anything that has been adapted or fashioned to extend the
the limitations of mind or body.  That covers an enormous amount of
ground and as such makes it difficult to create a model for tools and
tool use.

Jane Goodall's famous observation of a chimpanzee adapting a twig to
become a tool for extracting termites from a termite mound was a
revelation and made it clear that Man is not the only tool builder on
the planet.  And this extends beyond primates with Otters using tools
to open shellfish, and Crows and Ravens being adapt at fashioning a
number of found items to complete tasks.

But Man is still unique in the sheer number and complexity of the
tools created and uses.

The Wikipedia page for tools wasn't much help and is surprising both
how little it has to say on the subject as well as its brevity,
considering how critical tools are to our day to day survival and
success as a species.
