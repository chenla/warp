** TL;DR

A tool is anything that has been adapted or fashioned to extend the
the limitations of mind or body.  That covers an enormous amount of
ground and as such makes it difficult to create a model for tools and
tool use.

Jane Goodall's famous observation of a chimpanzee adapting a twig to
become a tool for extracting termites from a termite mound was a
revelation and made it clear that Man is not the only tool builder on
the planet.  And this extends beyond primates with Otters using tools
to open shellfish, and Crows and Ravens being adapt at fashioning a
number of found items to complete tasks.

But Man is still unique in the sheer number and complexity of the
tools created and uses.

The Wikipedia page for tools wasn't much help and is surprising both
how little it has to say on the subject as well as its brevity,
considering how critical tools are to our day to day survival and
success as a species.

*** Difference between machines and tools

Difference between a machine and a tool --> some machines are
considered to be both -- an electric hand drill is both tool and
machine because it uses an electric motor.  But as a general rule, if
something is powered by an external power source it is ususally
considered to be a machine rather than a tool.

In this sense a piano is a tool, but an organ is a machine.

A hand powered millstone is a tool, but when contected to gears which
are powered by wind spinning blades it becomes a machine.

Is a sail boat a tool or machine?  A bicycle could be seen as a tool,
and a motorbike a machine.

All of this becomes increasingly important as we build cognitive
machines which can autonomously or at least semi-autonomously use self
determination to choose and use a variety of tools to achieve a goal.

*** Tool Cultures and Traditions

Groups of tools belong to cultural traditions with their own
methodology and philosophy.  The Japanese develped a traditional of
woodworking and contruction that is distinct from that in the West.

Construction sites in the West divide work and the use of tools very
differently from how it is done in the East.

Tools are created differently for different skill levels.  Power tools
for people with little or no skill trade off safety issues at the
expense of how power and precision.  And since consumer grade tools
are not expected to be be used often, quality of the tool is purposely
kept low in order to keep the production costs down.  Single use,
disposable tools take this to it's logical conclusion.

Tools to create many identical copies of something must be both
powerful and precise, but not flexible.  This is one reason that an
automobile assembly line takes so long to "retool". The assembly line
tools are designed for very specific functions and very specific
tolerances.

Tools in a fabrication shop that develops prototypes need to be as
powerful, precise and as flexible as possible since there is no way of
knowing ahead of time what will be built.  Such tools are designed for
bottom up iterative design and development, where an assembly line is
top down and deterministic.

Tools used to repair things are in their own category as well.  Repair
shops are often dealing with a wide range of different products
created by assembly lines -- so need the power and precision of the
assembly line tools, but not the same infinite flexibility as tools in
a fabrication shop.  Repair shops typically deal with specified ranges
of specifications that are repeated over and over.  Repair shops are
diagnostiic in nature, understanding how systems work, determining
what went wrong and how to return it to a working state as close as
possible to it's original form.

*** Tool Environments

Tools are often designed to work within specific environments as part
of an ecosystem made up of multiple tools.  The tools in automobile
repair shop is designed around the assumption that the vehicle can be
lifted so that it can accessed from any side or from beneath the
vehicle.  Many of the tools require compressed air, others
electricity, all, that anything worked on can be properly illuminated.

The tools in a wood working shop will be different and used
differently from those by a carpenter working on the construction of a
building.

So lighting, heating, power sources, work benches, lifts, and boxes,
racks, bins, drawers and shelves will all be designed around the
toolchains and workflows required.

*** Tool Patterns

We need a systematic way of organizing tools that we can use in
developing tool patterns -- the patterns need to take into account the
goal, the nature and properties of the materials to be used, the
physics of how the finished product will function, the aesthetics of
what it will look like, the indended life cycle of what is created --
is this to be temporary, short term, long term, or permanent?

Can the tool be extended, can it be combined with other tools?  Is it
single purpose or general purpose?


** Table of Contents


  - Tools are an extension of the hand -- as a general rule.  But the
    hand is an extension of mind -- mind directs the hand and any tool
    that extends it.

  - Simply tools are more powerful and flexible than complex tools,
    but more difficult to master.

  - A Master is marked as someone who fashions customized tools as
    part of their methodology and workflow.  Painters used to now only
    make their own canvases, but their own brushes and paints as well.

  - Standardization of tools is important -- they become parts of
    larger technological cultures.

  - Specialization of tools let to a sort of Cambrian explosion of
    different types of specialized tools at the beginning of the
    Industrial revolution.  This was, in part, because specialized
    tools were easier to create using industrial processes.  It might
    also be because it allowed a larger number of less skilled people
    to be able to do work that was before the sole domain of Master
    craftsman.

  - Unix philosophy that each tool should do one task very well and
    then have a standardized system where every tool took standard
    input in the form of text, and returned standard output which
    could be used as input to another tool using a concept called
    Pipes. This created a modular toolchain that could be repurposed
    in a multitude of different ways.  Scripting languages extended
    this even further making it relatively easy to both create missing
    tools in a chain, or to aggreate toolchains into single script
    that behaved as a tool in it's own right.

  - another important advancement was standardized attatchments, so
    that a drill could use any number of different "drill" bits of
    different sizes that cold be swapped out so that one drill could
    be used to make a wide variety of different sized holes.

    - socket wrenches
    - screw drivers
    - saw blades
    - sandpaper
    - fishing rods, reels, hooks, lures, sinkers

  - standard connectors and plugs for power sources -- electrical,
    both socket and battery as well as pneumatic tools.
