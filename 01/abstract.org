** Scope

The first canto lays out the broad foundation for the work,
what is civilization, how did it emerge, what forms has it
taken throughout history, what are the driving forces behind
it.  What things have worked and we want to keep or bring
back?  What things did not or are not working and how do we
ensure that we don't repeat those mistakes?

This lays the groundwork for understanding different ways
that civilization might work in a technologically advanced
post-scarcity future that we are starting to see the
beginnings of today.


** TL;DR
Where to begin?

Civilization starts about xxx years before written systems
were first invented.  This sounds like it should be clear
cut, but our understanding of the transition from
hunter-gathers to sedantary agriculture surrounding citites
is changing rapidly.  Paleontologists have made some
remarkable discoverys in the past two decades that is
changing the narrative of how civlization started that has
been with us for centuries. cite:scott:2017against

** Proto-Civilizations


** Small and Scattered

Until the widespread use of chronometrics by paleontologists and
historians began actually listening to what the paleontologists were
discovering our understanding of our past was limited to what has been
written.  Since writing was concentrated in cities, and because urban
people are by definition, sedantary and don't move around much, they
wrote about what they knew, which is what was happening in
agricultural societies.  Anyone outside, was lumped together under the
generic term savages and no one really spent much thought about them
at all until the late 19th century.  Chronometrics is now making it
possible to begin building at least the outline of who these people
were, and where and how they lived.  There is little else we can know
because they left no record of their language, their cultures and
beliefs or their deeds.  From similar societies that survived until
the 19th century when a few scientists began to take notice of them,
we can make educated guesses about how their societies might have been
structured and the types of belief systems they held.  But unless time
travel become possible, most of what is unknown about these peoples
will remain unknown.

It's important to remember that even when sedantary
agricultural societies emerged, it was not so much a
revolution as much as small scale experiments.

As Scott points out, the vast majority of Humanity has lived
outside of cities or state influence, or at most lived on
the periphery up until the industrial revolution.  And even
then, it was only in xxxx that more than 50% of humanity
were urban.  In otherwords, Man as a whole has had no
practice or experience at building and maintaining
civilization as the primary mode of existence for Mankind.
Scaling civlization up to include all of humanity only
really began laying the groundwork at the very end of the
19th century with the beginning of the Steam Revolution and
even then it's only been the couple of generations since the
end of World War II that have been the first to live in a
global civilization.

This is all new folks, we are all pioneers trying this stuff
out for the first time.
