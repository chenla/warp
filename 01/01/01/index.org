  - Knowledge of how, but not why -- why not explored and
    often mapped to local mythology, and a passed-down tradition. 
  - Human scale  -- Within human cognitive limits
  - Level of Separation - single level of separation
  - Map (no key) -- The map borders on being a territory,  
    dense, local map, topographic, social, linguistic, cultural
  - Autochthonic -- native evolved organically
  - Transactive  -- distributed memory, making things
    more opaque.
  - Mētis as mastery -- "an accumulation of many, partly
    redundent signals" ([[pdfview:~/proj/chenla/hoard/lib/scott:1998seeing.pdf::329][p.313]]) reinforced memories from
    doing or seeing the same thing over and over until it
    becomes something close to a learned instinct.

  - An intense idosyncratic wisdom or knowledge of a
    locale, knowledge about how things work in a specific
    place, not in general or globally.  A common farming
    adage I heard as a child growing up in New England,
    was that if corn was "knee high by the fourth of
    July" it indicated an important benchmark that you
    had a good crop.  After several years observation, I
    came to the conclusion that the phrase was not coined
    by a New England farmer.  A brief search on the term
    turned up no origin for the term, but did show that
    for most 19th century farmers in the mid-west United
    States this was a not a bad rule of thumb.  By the
    late 20th century, the introduction of new corn
    varieties and high yield hybrids, corn is more likely
    to be "as high as an elephant's eye"

       Note: “The corn is as high as an elephant’s eye, /
               An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky"

       "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin", /Oklahoma!/, Rodgers
       and Hammerstein (1943).

There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
An' it looks like it's climbin' clear up to the sky

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a wonderful feelin'
Every thing's goin' my way

All the cattle are standin' like statues
All the cattle are standin' like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winkin' his eye

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
And oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a wonderful feelin'
Every thing's goin' my way

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The bees are so busy they don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willow is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a wonderful feelin'
Every thing's goin' my way now

Oh, what a beautiful day
Beautiful day

— "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin", /Oklahoma!/, Rodgers and Hammerstein (1943)

The kind of knowledge required in such endeavors is not
deductive knowledge from first principles but rather what
Greeks of the classical period called mētis, a concept to
which we shall return. Usually translated, inadequately, as
"cunning," mētis is better understood as the kind of
knowledge that can be acquired only by long practice at
similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant
adaptation to changing circumstances.

With distinct communities and incommensurable beliefs, the
layers seem to fall apart like decaying plywood; if they are
significantly disconnected—if there are distinct communities
using terms like “mass” and “energy” in significantly
different ways—then the continuity of one level would hardly
bolster discontinuity at another.

These considerations so exacerbated the problem that it
seemed as if any two cultures (groups with very different
systems of symbols and procedures for their manipulation)
would be condemned to pass one another without any
possibility of significant interaction. But here we can
learn from the anthropologists who regularly study unlike
cultures that do interact, most notably by trade. Two groups
can agree on rules of exchange even if they ascribe utterly
different significance to the objects being exchanged; they
may even disagree on the meaning of the exchange process
itself. Nonetheless, the trading partners can hammer out a
local coordination despite vast global differences. In an
even more sophisticated way, cultures in interaction
frequently establish contact languages, systems of discourse
that can vary from the most function-specific jargons,
through semispecific pidgins, to full-fledged creoles rich
enough to support activities as complex as poetry and
metalinguistic reflection.
