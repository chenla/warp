 Mētis is a greek word, Μῆτις which is commonly translated in english
 as "wisdom," or "cunning," but also embraces concepts of local
 knowledge, mastery through long practice and the ability to "think on
 one's feet," and adapt to changing circumstances.

There is no doubt that metis is a type of intelligence and of thought,
a way of knowing; it implies a complex but very coherent body of
mental attitudes and intellectual behaviour which combine flair,
wisdom, forethought, subtlety of mind, deception, resourcefulness,
vigilance, opportunism, various skills, and experience acquired over
the years. It is applied to situations which are transient, shifting,
disconcerting. and ambiguous, situations which do not lend themselves
to precise measurement, exact calculation or rigorous logic. Now, in
the picture of thought and intelligence presented by the philosophers,
the professional experts where intelligence was concerned, all the
qualities of mind which go to make up mētis, its sleights of hand, its
resourceful ploys and its stratagems, are usually thrust into the
shadows, erased from the realm of true knowledge and relegated,
according to the circumstances, to the level of mere routine, chancey
inspiration, changeable opinion or even charlatanerie, pure and
simple.

This brings us to the second type of reason for the
difficulties and—we believe—the interest of our undertaking.
Although mētis operates within so vast a domain, although
it holds such an important position within the Greek system
of values, it is never made manifest for what it is, it is never
clearly revealed in a theoretical work that aims to define it.
It always appears more or less below the surface, immersed
as it were in practical operations which, even when they
use it, show no concern to make its nature explicit or to
justify its procedures.

This is not much different to Kuhn's concept of a paradigm, at least
before the publication of /structure/.  It's not surprising that
paradigms largely go unnoticed.  A paradigm is a fabric that weaves
together both we consciously are aware of and pay attention to,
together with the unlying memories in our brains that are "an
accumulation of many, partly redundent signals." ([[pdfview:~/proj/chenla/hoard/lib/scott:1998seeing.pdf::329][Scott:p.313]]) When
enough of these signals have been accumulated they become a kind of
learned instinct or muscle memory which work below the conscious level
so that they don't have to be loaded into working conscious memory,
letting us use that to pay attention to the details and subtlies of
what is in front of us.  All of us has mastered many things, from
walking, to riding a bicycle, swiming, or writing.  Those who we call
masters have done the same thing, but in a narrow specialized range of
activity; Honokw & Azita playing ukulele in Waikiki, chess master
Magnus Calsen playing and winning 10 simultaeous games blindfolded, or
that Vietnamese car mechanic who seems to always know what's wrong
with your car after listening to it for 10 seconds.  You know, the guy
whose shop is a couple of blocks south of the Chinese grocery.
