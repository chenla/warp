  - Contents
  - [[./intro.org][Introduction]]

  - Savannah Heritage
    - savannah ecosystem
    - high generalized biodiversity
    - clemant
    - stability
    - evolutionary pressure to adapt -> we had to become bad
      motherfuckers to adapt and survive.
    - flexibily -> makes it easier to adapt to other
      climates/ecosystems
  - Primate Heritage
    - what advantages do primates have over other species
    - primate senses, compared to other animals
    - primate physical design
      - opposable thumbs --> Opposition and apposition
        - only old world monkeys and great apes 
    - omnivores have larger range of diet
    - omnivores share traits of both carnivores and herbivores
    - offspring are born before development is complete
      - this increases early mortality rates? does it?
      - means that we are exposed to environment earlier and can begin
        learning earlier.
      - core primate behaviors and instincts -- what is hardwired
  - The Accidental Apex
    - how we become an apex predator
    - we are designed to be in the middle of the food chain
    - brain evolved faster than other animals in ecosystem
    - we escaped natural checks and balances that other predators deal
      with.
  - Ocean Ancestry
    - we have inherieted many things from living in water
    - possibly will mitigate potential problems living in lower
      gravity
