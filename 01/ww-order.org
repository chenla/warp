  - Pattern Recognition

It is likely that not only humans, but all complex life, has evolved
to process information about the world and instinctively identify
order when they see it.

We do this hierarchically, with a large array of pattern recognizers
at the bottom looking for primitive patterns.  If there is a positive
match that pattern is past up the hierarchy to a layer that looks for
patterns amid the recognized patterns -- this continues up layer by
layer until complex patterns,  that's an apple, I can eat it.  or that
is a big ass storm on the horizon, I better head into port.

Our brains are at base, pattern recognition machines.  Patterns in the
chaos are meaningful because order indicates a number of things:

  - potential food
  - potential danger
  
the better the order, the more complex the order, the more interesting
it is.

Humans combine this capibility with abstract thinking to create all
sorts of meta patterns, analogies, metaphors, good and evil, right and
wrong. 

And at the heart of this are concepts like beauty and transcendental
concepts of the divine -- which recognize patterns that are greater
than the sum of their parts.

-------

This is so deeply wired that they are core to happiness and well
being.  If we are surrounded by complex patterns we recognize as
beautiful and divine, it materially contributes to our quality of
life.

This is what most people are really talking about when they talk about
the divine, mystical or God.  They are seeing something that we are
designed to see, that we have no choice but seeing, with the deep
understanding that these things are bigger than we are, and are in
many cases beyond our ability to articulate or even understand.  Most
of us are content to appreciate....

Beauty is not decorative, it is not something you tack on at the end,
it is intrinsic to the very nature and process of human cognition.

I don't think we are special in this regard -- most of not all higher
level animals have a strong sense of beauty which is essential to
their well being as well.

This then lays the foundations for ESTRANGEMENT, where we come to
terms with how Modern Man has become estranged from this deep
understanding of beautiy, complexity and our relationship to the world
and our place in it.
