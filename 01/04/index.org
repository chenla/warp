** Scope

We will then explore what Christopher Alexander called, in
his monumental work, /The Nature of Order/ which at its
heart attempts to place the idea of /quality/, what
Alexander calls "quality without a name" (QWAN).  QWAN is no
less than an attempt to understand the fundemental nature of
self-organizing matter, which in it's electro-chemical form
we know as Life.  But biological life is only a subset of
the larger concept of life in the universe.  We are hard-wired,
to recognize living structures and see them as things of
transcendent beauty and spirit.  This is not mere
aesthetics, or decoration, or a veener that makes something
attractive.  It goes to the very bones of the nature of the
universe itself and is difficult to discuss or understand
without sounding spiritual, because it /is/ spiritual but it
is not subjective.  The beauty or living order that results
in organization that is larger than the sum of it's parts,
that can hold back the inexorible law of entropy should be
considered to be transcendent and spiritual.


** Review and Summary of The Nature of Order

It took me a few months to read through all 4 volumes and I
will go through and read them again.  This is a monster
work that requires more than one reading.  The following is
a review on Amazon that does an excellent job of summing it
all up, though without reading the book, it doesn't help
much :)

The Nature of Order Volume 1: The Phenomenon of Life

Christopher Alexander

This is a book that will haunt you. You think you have
"seen" its purpose, and then you'll reread something, and
see new depths, reach new insights. You'll be frustrated you
don't have it with you to refer to at odd moments, when one
of its passages starts ringing bells, and illuminating bits
of your experience in new ways. Chris Alexander talks about
his journey over twenty five years to write the book, and
the efforts over five to ten years by students to grasp and
articulate and internalise his ideas.

But don't let these time scale put you off. It is also a
wonderfully illuminating book, and very clearly written. The
use of hundreds of contrasting photos of buildings, carpets,
ceramics, parking areas, and so on to illuminate the
concepts, and the presence of more or less life, is nothing
short of breath-taking. I found only one pair of pictures
leaving me feeling equivocal about what Chris was trying to
communicate.

If you are interested in art, architecture, design,
learning, cognition, religion, then you will gain immense
value from this book, whether from a furiously busy two
weeks on a loan from the library, or a purchase to treasure
and explore for the rest of your life.

The excerpts from the 476 pages identify and briefly explain
the fifteen properties, and attempt to give you a hint of
the power of this book.

.. the structure I identify as the foundation of all order
is also personal. As we learn to understand it, we shall see
that our own feeling, the feeling of what it is to be a
person, rooted, happy, alive in oneself, straightforward,
and ordinary, is itself inextricably connected with
order. 22.

Real life. .. is comfortable, rough around the edges, smooth
as if it had been rubbed together. This kind of life is the
ordinary life which is not connected to high art or
fashion. It has nothing to do with images. It occurs most
deeply when things are simply going well, where we are
having a good time, or when we are experiencing joy or
sorrow - when we experience the real. 38.

.. ordinary enough, or profound enough, to feel alive in
some degree. .. they are alive because they are - as far as
possible - concept free... They are vigorous and
straightforward, where the soul of the maker has entered the
thing - or where the ordinary processes of daily life,
uncontaminated by ideas or notions of what to do, has
unfolded in a way that we accept very easily. These things
make us comfortable because we recognize them as
genuine. 51.

THE FIFTEEN PROPERTIES:

1. LEVELS OF SCALE:

(can be) too far apart in scale to be coherent with each other. 147

2. STRONG CENTERS:

cumulative power of strong centers.. progressive quality. 153

3. BOUNDARIES:

If we apply the rule repeatedly, it says that every part, at
every level, has a boundary which is a thing in its own
right. This includes the boundaries themselves. They too
have boundaries, each of which is a thing in its own
right. What seems like one rule, then, is a pervasive
structural feature of enormous depth, which is in effect
applied dozens or hundreds of times, at different scales
throughout the thing. 162

4. ALTERNATING REPETITION:

The tired yet killing repetition comes from the fact that
what repeats is one-dimensional there is no alternation to
speak of, no living centers which repeat. And there are no
vital secondary centers repeating between the primary
ones. The difference between the kind of repetition which
has life, and supports life, and the kind which is banal,
always lies in this matter of alternation. 169

5. POSITIVE SPACE:

There is not a single space which is "leftover". ..every
shape is a strong center, and every space is made up in such
a way that it only has strong centers in its space, nothing
else besides. 176

6. GOOD SHAPE:

a shape which is itself, as a shape, made up of multiple
coherent centers. It is easiest to understand good shape as
a recursive rule. The recursive rule says that the elements
of any good shape are always good shapes themselves. 179

Partial list of properties required to make a good shape..

  - High degree of internal symmetries
  - Bilateral symmetry (almost always)
  - A well-marked center ( not necessarily at the geometric middle)
  - The spaces .. next to it are also positive
  - Strongly distinct from what surrounds it
  - Relatively compact (1:1, 1:2, occ 1:4)
  - Closure and complete feel 183

7. LOCAL SYMMETRIES:

over-simplified overall symmetry in buildings is most often
na√Øve and even brutal. 186. ... a large symmetry of the
simplified neoclassicist type rarely contributes to the life
of the thing because in any complex whole in the world,
there are nearly always complex, symmetrical forces at
work - matters of location, and context, and function -
which require that symmetry be broken. 187

.. the relative coherence of the patterns is an objective
matter of cognitive processing, independent of the person
who is judging, and independent of the particular kind of
experimental judgement which is used to measure it. .. but
the measure is subtle and refined. Even in the most coherent
patterns only (a few) of the segments are
symmetrical. 190,191

8. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY:

situations where centers are "hooked" into their
surroundings. Eg arcade or gallery. 195 The space in the
gallery belongs to the outside world, and yet simultaneously
belongs to the building - thus causing a fusion of the
two. 197

9. CONTRAST:

Life cannot occur without differentiation. Unity can only be
created from distinctness. .. for the thing to be whole, the
contrast has to be pronounced. 200. but it is not forced

10. GRADIENTS:

Qualities vary slowly, subtly, gradually, across the extent
of the thing. ..One quality changes slowly across space, and
becomes another. ..centers .. varying in size, spacing,
intensity, and character. 205.

11. ROUGHNESS:

.. the seemingly rough solution - which seems superficially
inaccurate - is in fact more precise, not less so, because
it comes about as a result of paying attention to what
matters most, and letting go of what matters
less. .. another essential aspect of the property of
roughness is its abandon. Roughness can never be consciously
or deliberately created. Then it is merely contrived. 211

12. ECHOES:

a deep underlying similarity - a family resemblance - among
the elements, so deep that everything seems to be related,
and yet one doesn't quite know why, or what causes
it. ..depend on the angles, and families of angles, which
are prevalent in the design. 218

13. THE VOID:

This emptiness is needed, in some form, by every center,
large or small. It is the quiet that draws the center's
energy to itself, gives it the basis of its
strength. 225. .. there is a great lack of simple, silent,
empty, large, calm space. 225

14. SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM:

geometrical simplicity and purity .. certain slowness,
majesty, quietness... it comes about when everything
unnecessary has been removed. 226. It comes from an
uncompromising steadfastness to function, following the
thing to its logical conclusion, refusing to be deterred by
convention. An extreme freedom. 227

15. NOT-SEPARATENESS:

when a thing lacks life, is not whole, we experience it as
being separate from the world and from itself. ..any center
which has deep life is connected, in feeling, to what
surrounds it, and is not cut off, isolated, or
separated. .. Those unusual things which have the power to
heal, the depth and inner light of real wholeness, are never
like this. .. 231. ..lack of abruptness, or sharpness.. 234.

The interplay of the properties:

The 15 properties are not independent. They overlap. In many
cases we need one of them to understand the definition of
another one. .. to define ALTERNATING REPETITION exactly, we
need to get clear that there is an alternation between
certain things or STRONG CENTERS which repeat... (which)
relies heavily on the GOOD SHAPE of the things that are
repeating.. 237. LEVELS OF SCALE ..are not discernible at
all , until we identify the things at different levels as
wholes... STRONG CENTERS and have GOOD SHAPE...which
contains powerful centers within the BOUNDARIES of the
shape. 237 It is the field of centers which is primary, not
the fifteen properties. Each of the properties describes one
of the possible ways in which centers can intensify each
other. Each one defines one type of spatial relationship
between two or more centers, and then shows how the mutual
intensification works in the framework of this
relationship. 241

Life will increase, or it will degenerate, according to the
degree to which the wholeness of the world is upheld, or
damaged, by human beings and human processes. 293

.. It is not easy to find what we really like, and it is by
no means automatic to be in touch with it. It takes effort,
hard work, and personal enlightenment to understand it and
to feel it. It requires liberation from opinions and
concepts and ego to experience deep liking. 316

My experiments show that, in general, people agree to a
remarkable extent about which objects are more, or less,
like their best, or better, or most whole selves. Very
surprisingly, it appears that this judgement is independent
of person-to-person differences and independent of
culture. .. Even if an observer is at first confused by the
question.. "Which of the two is more alive?", it allows him
to teach himself and to grow in his ability to judge the
matter. 319

We live in an era when people's likes and dislikes are
controlled by dubious intellectual fashions - often
supported by the media... It is only with maturity that we
learn to listen to our own heart and recognize what we truly
like. 342

A healthy human being is able, essentially, to solve
problems, to develop, to move towards objects of desire, to
contribute to the well-being of others in society, to create
value in the world, and to love, to be exhilarated, to
enjoy. The capacity to do these many positive things, to do
them well, and to do them freely, is natural. It arises by
itself. It cannot be created, artificially in a person, but
it needs to be released, given room. It does need to be
supported. It depends, simply, on the degree to which a
person is able to concentrate on these things, not on
others. 373

I hope these excerpts have done enough justice to the
richness and power of this book, and that they stimulate you
to buy a copy, study it with care, and then, in time, to use
it with flair. We are using it to help us design our
eco-village called Rosneath Farm.

Did some googling about Rosneath Farm, which looked like it
had great promise, but the owner of the land fucked it all
up and the project was mired in court battles for over five
years.

I believe the author of the review above was by Warwich
Rowell who seems to be the main person behind the project.
It also looked like he passed away....

One of the big problems with permaculture is the shear
amount of knowledge you need to be able to do it
successfully, and I don't think there are a lot of metrics
that have been pulled together that track how these systems
work and how much they can really produce.  Everything I
have seen so far is anecdotal.

Perhaps that's the agro app that I need to build on saltmine
-- a framework for managing polyculture farms and
communities.
