** TL;DR

Principles are organized along the same lines as the
Pace-Layer model that is explained
/Part 8. Scaffords/Pace-Layers/ and in /APPL/A Summary of
the Language/.

** Table of Contents
   - Slouching Towards Optimism
   - Enlightenment

   - Humanism
     - Humanist Principles
       - HM3.1 :: Knowledge of the world is derived by
                  observation, experimentation, and rational
                  analysis.
       - HM3.2 :: Humans are an integral part of nature, the
                  result of unguided evolutionary change.
       - HM3.3 :: Ethical values are derived from human need
                  and interest as tested by experience.
       - HM3.4 :: Life’s fulfillment emerges from individual
                  participation in the service of humane
                  ideals.
       - HM3.5 :: Humans are social by nature and find
                  meaning in relationships.
       - HM3.6 :: Working to benefit society maximises
                  individual happiness.

       - Any creative process From the poetic,
         philosophical, brainstorming (which I call the
         cathartic method (literally vomiting out ideas),
         day dreams, sleep dreams, to booze, drugs and and
         malarial fevers.  As Hunter Thompson might have
         said, I wouldn't endorse all of them but they've
         worked for me. As the scientist E O Wilson said, in
         science you start as a poet and end as a
         bookkeeper.
