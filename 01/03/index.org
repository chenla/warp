    - *Bios Layer* :Civilizations have seldom been
      understood as being a layer that we inhabit in a
      larger biosphere -- that the ecosystem we belong to is
      as much a part of civilization as anything else.
      Pretty much everything written about civilization only
      talks about ecosystems in terms of resources -- as if
      resources were external to the system.  A civilization
      in the middle of an Ice Age will be very different
      from a civilization during an era with a clement
      climate.  It is not enough to only talk in terms of
      carrying capacity, but also climate patterns,
      biodiversity, how difficult or easy is it to extract
      raw materials from the lithosphere.
