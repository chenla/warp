** Table of Contents
  - Table of Contents
  - [[./intro.org][Introduction]]
  - getting rid of the onion
    - Discard romanticism and her sister mysticism
    - Discard dogmatism, but don't throw away good ideas
    that happen to be part of discarded ideologies
    - as complicated as it needs to be -- not reductionism,
    which was the mistake that modernists made
  
  - mutually exclusive and irreducible
  - free of baggage
  - principles are not assumptions
  - at best laws, but at least facts.

  - No Zero Day -- ab initio, not tabla rasa -- we build
    on what works and what has worked -- if it doesn't
    work then discard it, change the system to fit human
    nature, not human nature to fit a system.
  - Don't be hasty -- things take as long to change as
    they take.
  - Be relentless as well as patient.
  - The last to escape -- hope, don't give in to despair
