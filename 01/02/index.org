** Table of Contents
  - Table of Contents
  - [[./intro.org][Introduction]]
  - 00. Getting rid of the onion
    - Discard romanticism and her sister mysticism
    - Discard dogmatism, but don't throw away good ideas
      that happen to be part of discarded ideologies
    - as complicated as it needs to be -- not reductionism,
      which was the mistake that modernists made
  
  - 00. Mutually exclusive and 
  - 00. Irreducible
  - 00. String Free
  - 00. No Assumptions
  - at best laws, but at least facts.

  - 00. No Zero Day -- ab initio, not tabla rasa -- we build
        on what works and what has worked -- if it doesn't
        work then discard it, change the system to fit human
        nature, not human nature to fit a system.
  - 00. Don't be hasty -- things take as long to change as
        they take.
  - 00. Be relentless as well as patient.
  - 00. The last to escape -- hope, don't give in to despair
