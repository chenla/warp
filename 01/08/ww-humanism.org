#+begin_quote
We therefore call upon all men and women to restore compassion to the
centre of morality and religion ~ to return to the ancient principle
that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, hatred or
disdain is illegitimate ~ to ensure that youth are given accurate and
respectful information about other traditions, religions and cultures
~ to encourage a positive appreciation of cultural and religious
diversity ~ to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all
human beings—even those regarded as enemies
