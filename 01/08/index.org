  - [[./intro.org][Introduction]]

  - 00. Getting rid of the onion
    - Discard romanticism and her sister mysticism
    - Discard dogmatism, but don't throw away good ideas
      that happen to be part of discarded ideologies
    - as complicated as it needs to be -- not reductionism,
      which was the mistake that modernists made
    - 00. Mutually exclusive and 
    - 00. Irreducible
    - 00. String Free
    - 00. No Assumptions
      - at best laws, but at least facts.
    - 00. No Zero Day -- ab initio, not tabla rasa -- we build
          on what works and what has worked -- if it doesn't
          work then discard it, change the system to fit human
          nature, not human nature to fit a system.
    - 00. Don't be hasty -- things take as long to change as
          they take.
    - 00. Be relentless as well as patient.
    - 00. The last to escape -- hope, don't give in to despair

    - 01. Enlightenment
       - Not Enlightenment
         - High Modernism

         - Libertarianism
         - Lamarkism
    - 02. [[./ww-humanism.org][Humanism]]

    - Cogntive
    - Structural
    - Social


    - 03. Rationality
       - appealing to empirical based reasoning
       - intuition (hunch) as a first guess that must be tested. 
       - deduction (a priori/a postereriori)
       - induction
       - methodology in which truth is not sensory
       - skepticism
       - utilitarian
       - pragmatic
       - secular
       - Enlightened Self-Interest
       - Empathic Reciprocity
    - 04. Democracy
       - As goldilock zone between violence of anarchy and
         violence of popularism/totalitarianism/oligarchies
       - Egalitarian
    - 05. Human Nature
       - Human Scales: Self, Domus/Band, Polis
    - 06. Science
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Scientific_Method_as_an_Ongoing_Process.svg
      - Observation
      - Empirical 
        - evidence based
      - Hypothesis development
        - Any creative process From the poetic,
          philosophical, brainstorming (which I call the
          cathartic method (literally vomiting out ideas),
          day dreams, sleep dreams, to booze, drugs and and
          malarial fevers.  As Hunter Thompson might have
          said, I wouldn't endorse all of them but they've
          worked for me. As the scientist E O Wilson said, in
          science you start as a poet and end as a
          bookkeeper.
      - Prediction
     - Testable and repeatable
     - Record/Document and Share
     - Analysis
     - External Review
     - Consensus
   - 07. [[./ww-progress.org][Progress]]
     - not same as growth
     - The unveness of progress
       progress is not evenly distributed
     - Evidence of Progress

-----

A Rule Set based on these principles that includes
metasystems, patterns, parameters and theses which can
generate a full set of articles.

How to go about doing this?

Pseudo-first-order-logic-code?

MM3 provides base principles

Not enlightenment provides canary tests

Scientific process

entity mode provides mulitple formats, wording etc for
different targets.

duck tests
canary tests

I sort of like the idea of leveraging rulesets as a
framework for judges -- they go through each step in the
process and act as the AI for determing if something
applies or not.

Common Law is a powerful concept, but it would be nice if
each time a judge makes a ruling then the ruling will have
it's own variation of the ruleset -- higher courts could
then determine which variation is to be used.

So where do we put ducks and canaries

Ducks and Canaries are definitions as well as a tests -- so
should they belong in patterns?  They are, after all a kind
of pattern.

Define living, dead, true, false, sentient, consent, adult,
liable etc.

Can baysian reasoning be used to define things like "beyond
reasonable doubt?"
