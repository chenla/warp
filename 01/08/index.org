       - Any creative process From the poetic,
         philosophical, brainstorming (which I call the
         cathartic method (literally vomiting out ideas),
         day dreams, sleep dreams, to booze, drugs and and
         malarial fevers.  As Hunter Thompson might have
         said, I wouldn't endorse all of them but they've
         worked for me. As the scientist E O Wilson said, in
         science you start as a poet and end as a
         bookkeeper.

-----

A Rule Set based on these principles that includes
metasystems, patterns, parameters and theses which can
generate a full set of articles.

How to go about doing this?

Pseudo-first-order-logic-code?

MM3 provides base principles

Not enlightenment provides canary tests

Scientific process

entity mode provides mulitple formats, wording etc for
different targets.

duck tests
canary tests

I sort of like the idea of leveraging rulesets as a
framework for judges -- they go through each step in the
process and act as the AI for determing if something
applies or not.

Common Law is a powerful concept, but it would be nice if
each time a judge makes a ruling then the ruling will have
it's own variation of the ruleset -- higher courts could
then determine which variation is to be used.

So where do we put ducks and canaries

Ducks and Canaries are definitions as well as a tests -- so
should they belong in patterns?  They are, after all a kind
of pattern.

Define living, dead, true, false, sentient, consent, adult,
liable etc.

Can baysian reasoning be used to define things like "beyond
reasonable doubt?"
