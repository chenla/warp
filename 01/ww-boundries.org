** TL;DR

Boundries define the limits that our planet, all of life,
our species, civilization and ourselves as individuals must
work within.  They include hard physical limits that systems
need to work within or collapse.  They include limits that
societies need to stay within or decline and collapse.  They
include human cognitive limits and bias of which there are
many.

Boundries mostly come down to the fact that most things are
designed to work at certain scales.  We don't see dragonflys
that are several meters long any longer because insects take
in oxygen through their skin (they don't breath with lungs
or gills) and monster dragonflies were only possible because
the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere allowed insects
to scale far larger than they can today.

Overall having a lower level of oxygen in the atmosphere is
a good thing.  Oxygen is a very dangerous element because it
reacts with so many things.  Oxygen burns, it reacts with
metals like iron can causes rust.  The astronauts in the
Apollo space died because of a flash fire caused by a spark
because the capsule was using pure oxygen instead of mixing
it with an inert gas such as nitrogen which makes up the the
bulk of earth's atmosphere.

So it's important that we are aware of all of these
boundries that, well, bound us.  Some of these bondries
benifit and others limit and work against us.  But either
way we can't get around them and we must design systems that
work within them.
