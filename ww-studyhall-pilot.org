** Gender Equality in Digital Development

We are very edgy, interested in edges, places where technology is approaching a threshold that triggers a cascade that transforms a country's economy and social structures.  For the past 30 years I have lived and worked on the cutting edge of IT development in East and South East Asia.  In each country I have lived, that country was nearing a tipping-point that results in systemic change.  In mainland China in the '80s it was data networks, in the '90s in Hong Kong it was Internet and the beginning of the World Wide Web.  For the past five years we've been working on what we call Slow AI.  Machine-cognitive systems for managing processes that are too slow for people to notice. Our biggest problem is finding local people who have the skills to work in this area. We've always worked with women, as partners, developers, designers and our best managers.  Cambodia is in a period of enormous economic and cultural change.  But from an IT perspective they are still stuck in what we call the Microsoft Bubble stage of economic development.  IT education focuses on teaching MS techologies used by large organizations, and now Web App and Mobile App development. Yawn. 

It's difficult to find programmers here who have even heard of languages like Python or Ruby, let alone Haskell, Lisp, R and the newcomers Rust and Golang which hopefully will replace C++ and Java respectively (and the sooner the better).  No one knows linux, or containerization, or even version control! 

We need people with these skills and we especially need women who have these skills.  Why women?  Men and women are equally intelligent, and yet if you have 50 men and 50 women, in IT most of the men will get hired, or at least hired first, and the smartest and hardest working women will struggle to find jobs that match their skills.  We've found that it's easier to find extremely smart and talented women than men.  We've also found that women in IT have far better communication skills than their socially challenged male counterparts. 

Cambodia needs people with advanced IT skills if they are going to be able to break out of the Microsoft Bubble and start using advanced technologies.  It's like in the movie Field of Dreams -- build a skilled labor pool and they will invest.  If we can pave the way in Cambodia and show how to teach these advanced technologies, other schools will follow our lead.  But when they do, the focus will be on men and women won't be left behind, but they will struggle. 

For this reason we need to focus both on teaching the technologies that will make Cambodia competitive in IT and to address the gender gap in education and in hiring.  This is why our focus is on teaching women.  We need to learn how to address the special challenges that they face and show employers that it's to their advantage to hire women. 

** Proposal Summary

We are primarily a research group that was established in 2005 to initially develop technologies for building highly scalable distributed long term libraries that can maintain collections for hundreds and hopefully thousands of years that capture and preserve the surrounding context of what is in collections so that future generations will be able to understand we were talking about.  The project first started in Japan in 1998 and was meant to become a companion library to become part of the 10,000 year clock that is being built by the Long Now Foundation.  The clock, which is over two floors tall, is being build now in mountain in Texas and is designed to run with little or no human intervention for 10,000 years. 

The work on the library made us realize that libraries can not be treated as time capsules to be locked away in a cave.  There is nothing wrong with time capsules, but a library is a living breathing repository of human memory and experience.  Libraries are the genome for civilizations. 

The digitization revolution quickly made us realize that libraries, which think and work at far slower time scales than at faster pace-layers where knowledge was being created.  Simply put, libraries were being left behind, and the institutional functions that libraries provide to civilization were not being addressed by the dotcom boom. 

Since then we have worked to re-imagine electronic libraries no as repositories of works, but as maps of human knowledge. We began work on what we call Slow AI, a semi-autonomous cognitive machine that thinks and works at time scales which are too slow for humans.  The library might be our memory, but we need processes that ensure that bit rot doesn't destroy these collections over decades and centuries, and to integrate new material, literally weaving it into collections so that these libraries can become the foundation for a wide variety of application from forestry, groundwater management, monitoring of nuclear waste storage, climate monitoring and change and institutional management of national infrastructure. 

As we stated before, people with advanced skills are critical to our project.  And women are being left behind.

After three decades living in the region we are aware of the special challenges that women in SE Asia have in addition to the challenges that women in developed countries have. 

Social structures in SE Asia are still anchored around tight-knit villages (even in big cities) which are made up of extended families.  Most families only have enough money to send one or two children to university and most of the time it's the boys that are sent.  Like my mother who grew up in the great depression, the only way she was able to go to college was to do it on her own.  Her family didn't provide any financial support, that went to the boys. 

However, it's women in countries like Cambodia who are the backbone of family structures.  They are expected to generate income, take care of the house, cook, clean and raise children and the elderly.  There is very strong pressure placed on them to stay within the village and family.  This is the single biggest challenge.  We need to find solutions for women here that allow them to meet the needs of their families expectations, but also to build their own lives and careers. 

This is where Remote Work comes into play. There are a growing number of often very successful companies whose work force work from where they live, scattered around the planet. 

We want to prepare women to work anywhere they want, but if they are unable to leave the country or move to a big city away from their family and village these these kinds organizations provide a flexible means of providing these women with very good jobs and the flexibility to also meet family expectations.  It's not enough to teach people skills if they are unable to go to where the jobs are.  So we will bring the jobs to them and find ways to make that work. 

** Motivation to start project

All of our work is grounded in the ideals founded in the Enlightenment; rationality, scientific process, understanding and making allowances for human limitations, and a drive improve peoples lives today, while working on long term solutions that will help all of civilization to progress.  We believe that we can achieve these goals living and working in places like Cambodia more than in Berlin or Silicon Valley. 

Educating women has made the single biggest impact on humanity in the last hundred years.  Educating women will eventually bring population explosion under control.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Women in SE Asia have more influence on their children and families than anyone else.  If your mom is smart and educated, you will have a far better chance of also becoming smart and educated. Investing in women in developing countries is an investment in the entire country.  The women will drag the men along with them up the ladder if they want to or not. 

The pilot program we are establishing is located at Prek Leap National College of Agriculture.  The school is in the process of upgrading to become a National College of Agricuture and Technology.  Our partnership with the school is to help bring the technology side to the school and to return the school to being a research school as it was before the Khmer Rouge. 

Over three quarters of our students are from remote provinces.  We have the experience needed to reach women and help them no matter where they are from.  The school provides housing (not great housing but we're working on that too) and an environment that students who aren't from urban areas feel comfortable. 

Since the school is under both the ministry of agriculture and the ministry of education we are in a good position to find potential candidates for the program from anywhere in the country. 

** What Innovations?

1. Estabish baseline communication, critical thinking and problem solving cognitive skills -- learning how to learn. 2. Instill the habit of life-long learning, it starts in the cradle and ends in the grave.  This is a habit that is contagious, and will be passed on to student's children. 3. Education is not a place, it is a process and a frame of mind that is part of everything you do, so we will provide a framework designed so that all material can be used in classroom and as life-long self-directed independent study. 4. Mastery learning ensures that everyone progresses only when they have mastered what they are working on.  So students will not be left behind, and courses will not progress in group lockstep.  5. Blended learning techniques "flip the classroom" so that students watch lectures as 10 minute videos before class and then class time is spent on actual work and practice to master the material with the help of instructors.  6. A Resume is a terrible way for employers to gain a sense of a person's work and kills. Each student will have a public Git repository (on Github) which will contain all of their classwork and project work. Their repo will show what they can do, not just tell people what they can do.  7. We are in the process of establishing a mentorship program with professional women working in IT from around the world.  We will match each student with a IT professional who will act as a mentor and sometimes even a tutor who will help students through the course material. Mentors will be encouraged to visit Cambodia where they can stay at the school for a few days or even a few weeks and establish a personal relationship with their student, and will be encouraged to make their own videos at the school in the fields they are experts in. 
** Objectives

The main objectives are that over a four year program of study that students will obtain the core communication and technical skills needed for jobs in one of two tracks. 

The first track will be as system administrators and DevOps coordinators who work between operations and development. This is especially important for companies who do continious release. 

The second track will be to work as machine learning developers.  Machine learning skills are in very high demand and are set to become the largest growth sector in the IT industry.  As Kevin Kelly wrote, in the 19th century all you needed to do to get rich was to take something mechanical and electrify it.  The same thing is happening today by taking anything that uses software and adding AI to it. 

Third, through mentorship programs, working on real world open source projects in classes, and remote internships students will graduate with a portfolio of work, and experience working in a company. 

Fourth, we will work to develop the physical infrastructure for women to be able to do these jobs.  Village life is very intense and chaotic.  For this to work, women will need what Virginia Woolfe called "a room of one's own".  We will work with students to develop solutions to this problem directly.  There are a number of different ways it can be done, and Remote Work companies commonly provide funds to workers to need to rent a room, or even a budget to work out of a coffee shop.  It's premature to say what those solutions are until we know what the specific needs of the students in the program will have. 

One thing you notice when you spend time in villages is that from very early age, children learn to help take care of younger children around them at a lower cognitive developmental stage than they are.  It's facinating to watch, and it works very well.  In India there is a saying that the last step in learning something is to teach it.  So putting this together, it will be natural for students to contribute to the course material and to help students who are coming up behind them.  We will encourage students to make their own videos.  In fact this will be an important part of the program.  It's not enough to make one video that everyone watches.  It's better to have the same topic covered by several people from different perspectives.  This will be an important part of reinforcing materal covered over time that will be part of using spaced repitition as a teaching method. 

Safety is difficult and needs much more consideration, but we believe that creating save online communities and fostering a habit of looking out for one another in students, instructors and mentors will be an important part of this process.  Bad things happen when they are secret, and being part of a community in which everyone has each other's back will be one of the programs core principles. And online safety is only a small part of that.  Domestic violence, peer pressure and the inevitable messiness of realtionships  with the opposite sex, both romantically, socially and professionally are all equally important. 

** Benifits to community

Benefits are all bottom up.  You find the key person in a community that will in turn help lift everyone else up with them.  Education is like that.  As we've already statd above, women in a village and family are the cornerstone of everything that happens in that community.  In villages, men and women occupy somewhat different spheres.  Men have their fighting-cocks and like to drink and eat and spend a lot of their free time with other men.  Women are connected to all generations and influence everyone, both men and women, from babies to grandparents.  Solve their problems and you will see that all the lives around them will improve as well. Because a woman's problems are the same as the families problems. 

The most important part of the curriculum that will infect everyone at home over time will be critical thinking, and problem solving and communication skills.  It's hubris to think that any one project will solve much of anything.  You must be in it for the long haul, and think in terms of making long term impact over generations.  To some extent the old saying that you can't teach an old dog new tricks is true.  Humans have limited capacity to adapt and change in a lifetime unless from an early age you give them a cognitive tool box that allows them to keep learning and changing throughout their lives.  It is these habits and skills that students will infect their children and other chilren around them with, that will have a long term impact. 

How will it benifit our team?  First, a large part of our long term goals is rethinking education for the 21st century.  So the program will be a laboratory for finding out what works and what doesn't. 

Second, we need people with these skills for our larger Slow AI projects, so we hope that some students will join our team. 

Third, all students will be exposed to our larger goals and projects and we hope that when they go out into the workforce that they will help spread the ideas we are developing if and when it makes sense to do so.  If we are developing things that are useful, people will use them. It's as simple as that. 

Finally, we don't do zero-sum anything.  Everything we do must contribute to improving peoples lives, and in so doing, making the world a better place and improving our own lives. 

** Methodologies

In the innovation section we outlined our core methodologies.  So putting them all together goes something like the following: 

The first two years of study will be evenly split between learning out to learn and improving english communication skills, both spoken, written and reading.  The IT industry constitutes a subculture that includes it's own cultural mythos, slang and traditions.  Earlier this month, the president of SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell was asked on stage, as a bit of a lame joke, "okay, Star Wars or Star Trek?" Without hesitation she just answered "Firefly."  There were cheers in the audience and I'm sure the person who asked the question didn't understand what happened.  But with that answer Shotwell instantly told everyone within the tech subculture that she was one of them.  It's not enough for students to learn how to code, they need to become part of the subculture that they will be working in.  We will use that cultural subculture as a means of teaching critical thinking and communication skills. 

One reason that women have a diffcult time being accepted in the IT subculture by other men is that they didn't grow up in that subculture and are treated as outsiders.  Ensuring that students understand that larger culture that they will be part of and that they will become part of a global IT community will be very important. 

As for learning the actual technical skills, the most important thing there is that people learn by doing.  And the sooner you are learning by working on real projects, not just exercises, the faster they will learn and be able to contribute to the projects they will work on. 

** Technical Details
To teach these skills there isn't a lot of distinction between hardware and the software stack that is running on them.  We already have an advanced hardware and software stack which is up and running that will provide students with all of the resources they will need. 

We will use an existing multi-media studio next door to our classroom for making videos. 

We already have an OpenStack cluster for virtual machines. Students will each have their "project' on the Openstack Cluster where they can manage and create any number of virtual machines which will be used to gain practical experience they will need in their jobs and in order to complete class assignments. 

We already have an OpenShift cluster for containerized processes.  Virtual machines are being replaced in many cases with containerized processes like Docker.  It's important that students learn to develop and manage software running both in containers and or in virtual machines.  The OpenShift cluster will provide that. 

We already have set up a dedicated group GitLab Server for all work which is separate from their public portfolio on GitHub. 

We will install a dedicated Mattermost group server which is an open source version of Slack.  This is where most online class interaction will take place, both with other students, instructors and with mentors.  In Remote Work companies, Slack or something like Mattermost along with email and git repositories is the core means of project development, communications and managment.  Students will learn to work in this environment almost from day one. 

Every student will have their own laptop and a large format tablet (the tablet is important for reading technical materials in epub and pdf formats). 

All class work will employ a concept called Literate Programing, which combines documentation (or any kind of document) with code.  All code will be part essay and part source code.  The code can be run inside the documents using both Jupyter Notebooks (iPython) which are becoming standard in the sciences.  But most work will use the Emacs Text Editor, Orgmode which is a literate programming (some call it literate DevOps) framework which combines code from any language into documents.  Code can then be tangled, automatically and run as a traditional software application or run within the document like in a Jupyter notebook. Everything will be kept and shared in Git repositories. 

A special built classroom which is designed for students to work together on projects, rather than sit and listen to lectures.  The school has already given us the classroom and we recieve funding for and begin rennovation in June. 

The funding that we are requesting will largely be spent on building the course materials, videos and written materials and software infrastructure for the pilot program as well as training instructors and mentors.  There will be a sharp learning curve for instructors and mentors to learn and become comfortable with the methodologies we will implement. 

To write this application I using the entire hardware and software stack outlined above.

** Expected Impact

The most important impact we expect is in the larger cambodian ITC industry.  There are already a number of companies who have told me that they desperately need people with these skills to fill existing positions.  There are even more who have told me that they aren't adopting these technologies because they can't find people with the skills to use them. 

We expect that building a labor pool of people with advanced IT skills will have a significant impact that will greatly increase what Cambodian companies are able to do in ITC. 

This will also make Cambodia a more attractive place for foriegn investment.  I have been told repeatedly by foreign companies that they would love to open offices in Cambodia if they could find people with the skills they need.  This program will provide that. 

We will also provide outreach and education to teach employers here in Cambodia about how Remote works and how it can work for their companies.  So over time we hope that graduates who can not move to Phnom Penh will be able to work for Cambodian companies from anywhere in Cambodia. That is still a long ways off, but we believe that eventually local companies will adopt the same practices as foreign companies. 

Our biggest impact though will be as being an example and template that other schools can use in their own programs. We intend to hold an ongoing series of seminars for Cambodian educators to help them learn how to bring these ideas and techniques their own schools. 

** Follow-up

We have made a ten year commitment to PrekLeap to not only as a pilot program but to use it as a way for the school to bootstrap a new permanent computer science degree program.  We see Chalkhall as an ongoing laboratory for developing educational techniques and learning material. 

As the program here matures we intend to duplicate the pilot program at another university in Champasak in Laos.

** Maintaining the project

We have been working on our larger projects since 2006 full time with little or no funding, using donations of used equipment and volunteer help. 

Lack of funding is less importand than making a long term commitment to the project goals and to continue the work with or without funding.  This program will launch with or without this grant.  Our partner founded the World Beat Cultural Center in Balboa Park San Diego.  The Beat started with no funding, still get's little funding, and yet over thirty years later it's still there, still helping disadvantaged children.  And they will be there for another thirty years.  That is the kind of commitment we have to our work in Cambodia. 

This is our home, and this work is our life, it's not another NGO project where everyone packs up when the funding runs out and move on to the next shiny funded project. 

Everything we build is designed to be part of something larger.  We aren't going anywhere, just as most of our students will live the rest of their lives in Cambodia. 

That said, the remote work companies we are talking to are expected to sponsor student tuitons and provide laptops and
tablets for students.

We already have a dozen local and expat IT professionals who will volunteer to make videos, and work as mentors and tutors. We will also recieve placement fees from companies who hire our graduates, eventually we hope that those fees will end up funding instructor salaries. 

We still need to secure additional funding for insructors until we are self sufficient but we have enough volunteers and resources now to see our pilot program through until all students graduate.
