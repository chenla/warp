** Scope
Natural resources can often be treated as a type of infrastructure,
both in terms of flows of water, heat, light.  But also stores of
ground water, oil and gas (commonly refered to as reserves, geothermal
heat.  In this context, we think of nature as something to be managed
and distributed.

That control is very limited, natural forces will always be bigger
than we are, and pose dangers in the form of earthquakes, typhoons,
volcanos, droughts, floods and fire.  Infrastructure for mitigating
forces beyond our control comes in the form of warning systems,
defensive sea walls and contigency plans for evacuations and recovery
from catastrophic destruction of human settlements and infrastructure.
