** Scope

Commons is a general term for shared resources in which each
stakeholder has an equal interest.  Infrastructure can be
thought of as a sort of hybid commons.  Infrastructure
connects things together, provides a control structure for
flows of material, energy, and information.  At any given
time, any piece of infrastructure may be owned and
controlled privately, or collectively.  But because that
infrastructure is critical to maintaining a functional
system or society, private infrastructure might be
nationalised and national infrastructure privatized.  This
creates a kind of negative feedback loop that ensures that
that infrastructure remains in place and functional.

In a post-scarcity civilization, the concept of the commons
will be displace many things that are treated as being
owned, by a person or corporate body and this will be most
pronounced in a new concept of infrastructure as more
of a commons than property that is equally shared.  In fact
the entire concept of commons as property could be be
redefined as a common equally shared resource.


** TL;DR

- Private & Public
     Even when infrastructure is privately owned, if it is
     essential to maintaining civilization, States have
     always had the option of either nationalizing or
     privitizing. This provides a negative feedback loop.

     New Classes of Infrastructure nearly always begin in
     the private sector and eventually become public and are
     increasingly regulated as it becomes a critical part of
     civilization.
- Nationalization & Privitization
     If private infrastructure goes off the rails (so to
     speak) is may be nationalized, reorganized and run as a
     public utility.  If State management becomes too
     inefficient or corrupt, infrastructure may then be
     privatized. Many examples.
- Right of Way
- Self-Owned
     In United States corporate law, a private incorporated
     company has nearly all the same rights as an
     individual.  This brings up the possibility of AI's
     being self-owned corporations with no human owners.
   
     A self-driving car not having an owner, but instead sells
     it's services to transport people and goods, and the
     revenue used go to fuel, repairs and saving to replace
     itself with a new vehicle.
