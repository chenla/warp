** Scope

Almost everything is a kind of infrastructure.  Governance, education,
production, law, electrical grids, road systems, airports, petrol
stations, post offices, courts, banks, telephone networks etc.  In
most cases infrastructure is made up of networks that are systems that
connect things together.

And because infrastructure's purpose is to connect things together it
is a pace-layer that is dead in the middle; it can't change to fast or
too slow.  It must adapt and be maintained fast enough to support the
faster pace-layers, but slow enough to ensure that it's around long
enough for the lower layers to provide their functions.

Infrastructure is as much in the public as the private sector.
Commerce taking the form of private sector corporate bodies might be
given the task of managing parts of infrastructure, but they are not
private, they must be accessible to everyone to be infrastructure.

A lot of infrastructure is even slower to change than the cultural
layer.  This is clearly seen in the layout of roads in cities.  The
structures in cities may change at wildly different rates of
change, the roads remain in place for centuries or even millennia.

Infrastructure as a rule has humble beginnings and over time is
reinforced and expanded using the same paths laid down by the first
inhabitants.

They say the cows laid out Boston.  Well,there are worse surveyors.

To some degree this is true of most cities that grew organically
rather than were centrally planned.  And most of the centrally planned
city layouts only happened after major catastrophes such as fire and
war raised large swaths of a city and needed to be rebuilt quickly.
Megafauna often do a better job than central planners.  Megafauna will
find the easiest route from one point to another and will follow the
same paths as they become beaten down and easier to follow.  Humans
follow the megafauna when they are hunters, and when man settled down
and became farmers those paths were formed by domesticated megafauna
which were easier to walk on that blazing a trail through grass and
brush.  Those paths eventually were broadend over time to allow more
traffic and eventually became roads.  And many roads, once laid out
stay in place for very very long times.

In the same way, when railroad networks were built, they didn't follow
paths laid out by animals or even  existing roads, but they did
connect settlements that were originally built along such routes.  The
railway networks became the physical template for other
infrastructure.  AT&T built telegraph networks that followed railway
tracks.  Many of the first telcos such as Sprint originally were
railroad companies.

Today, the Chinese government is building a rail and road network that
spans all of China east and west and through the 'stan countries all
the way to Europe following the same trading networks established in
the Middle Ages that became known as the Silk Road.

In this sense, all infrastructure is a kind of commons which is
maintained by a patchwork of governments, individuals and companies.
But in the larger and long term sense, they are owned by everyone and
each agent or entity that controls or claims ownership of any one part
of infrastructure is a custodian of that infrastructure more than an
owner.  Over time nations and corporations come and go, but so long as
there is a civilization in place, the infrastructure will remain in
place, and often the same places for very long periods of time.

All of this might seen obvious, but to many people it isn't.  It's
important to maintain and manage commons, and keep access to it as
open as possible.  This extends to knowledge and creative works that
encode or embody that knowledge.  Knowledge is a commons that everyone
builds on top of.  To claim that one entity "owns" something that was
only possible to build because of the previous work done by those who
came before us is ludicrous.  And restricting access to knowledge that
has been recorded and improved over many generations is both theft and
has the effect of slowing or even stopping innovation and discovery
that our species needs for surival.  It should literally be considered
to be a crime against humanity.

Creating new works that expand and extend and improve civilization are
never done in isolation from what came before them, they like cow
paths that turned into roads.  This is why all copyright law is based
on the concept that knolwedge is a type of commons and that copyright
is a /temporary/ monopoly granted to either restrict access to that
knowledge to gain advantage over others -- power.  Or as an monetary
incentive to create new works.  Both are weak and ultimately futile in
the long term, but are effective and destructive in the long term.

Knowledge is not a good or a service, and therefore can not be treated
as property.  Anything that is not property is part of the commons
and is owned by everyone.  Conflating insentives to create with
ownership of something owned by everyone needs to stop.
