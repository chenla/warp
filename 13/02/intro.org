** Scope
Much of infrastructure can be understood as types of systems made up
of stores and flows and regulated by negative feedback loops.
Infrastructure dynamically changes to meet the needs it is built for.
Over time infrastructure is abandoned, or dismantled, expanded,
upgraded or downsized. In many industrialized states, many railway
lines were abandoned, and at the beginning of this century, the global
network of "pay telephones" have largely been dismantled, and in
developing economies never built in the first place.  While whole new
classes of infrastructure have undergone enormous change.  State
regulation of spectrum, which is a sort of natural resource for
wireless communications was very crudely regulated and allocated.
Technological advances has made large amounts of spectrum, both wide
and narrow useful.  In the 20th century only a narrow part of
bandwidth was regulated and even then, used for radio communications,
and broadcast of television signals.  In some countries some of the
spectrum for television broadcasts have been repurposed for
communications as video transmission was first digitized and moved to
high speed optical fiber networks.
