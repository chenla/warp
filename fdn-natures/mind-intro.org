Mind is, at the moment, still confined to biological
cognitive systems -- brains but not for long.  Machine
cognition is already here whether we want to admit it or not
and it leaves a lot of us deeply uneasy.

Machines, like a toaster, or rice cooker or motorbike are
simular to our limbs -- our arms, hands and fingers are
machines that can be animated and controlled for a task.

But cognitive machines that do not need us to control
mechanical machines are doing something that only biological
cognitive machines could do before.  If tools and machines
are extensions of our bodies, then cogntitive machines are
extensions of our minds.  But we need to separate
computation from cognition.  A pocket calculator performs
calculations that before could only be done by our brains --
that is externalizing and extending the brain.  But a
cognitive machine that can do things without our direction
is an entirely horse of a different color.  They are in
effect semi-independent thinking machines.  They are
extremely limited in what they can do.  And it's important
that we don't project ourselves onto these systems and give
them attributes that they don't have.  A flatworm has a
cognitive machine controlling it -- that doesn't mean that
flatworms are going to organize themselves and rise up and
destroy us.  We need to make peace with the fact that
consciousness and intelligence is not special to humans, and
that it takes all sorts of forms which most of us would not
call intelligent or possessing of consciousness.  But to do
that is making the mistake that all consciousness and
intelligence must be relative to ourselves.  Our
intelligence and consciousness is extremely specialized for
life on the savannah, and is terrible at doing a lot of
things.  If we can stop projecting ourselves onto the world
around us and stop thinking that we are the pinnacle of
creation or evolution or much of anything else, we can begin
to make some progress to understanding what we are and how
cognitive machines that we have created fit into the larger
picture and what it means.

We, as individuals and cultures and civilizations will need
to clear away the misconceptions, clean out the cobwebs in
our brains and come up with a common sense concept of what
constitutes a mind and conciousness -- and banish the idea
of a soul and afterlife to the dustbin along with an earth
centered universe, deism in all of it's guises, and the
aether.  And we will need to do it pretty damn soon, or a
lot of things will be much more difficult, or begin to fall
apart on us.  We need a framework for understanding the
world we live in, not try to preserve world-models from past
ages that have ossified into dogmatic cognitive dissonance.

Our minds are indeed ghosts in the machine, but
less as a disembodied spirit as much as a projector casting
a dancing image on the cave wall.  Turn off the projector,
and the image is gone, it doesn't live on in something other
plane of existence disembodied from the lamp that projected
it.

This is not to say we must reject our cultural mythos --
afterall it still is a core part of who and what we are, and
how we relate to the world and each other.  There are a lot
of reasons for monotheism to have emerged roughly at the
same time in the form of several religions including Islam,
Christianity, a monotheistic Judasim and Buddhism within
centuries of each other and then domainate the world
relatively quickly.  It's not always apparent, but the great
monotheistic religions adapted previous polytheistic belief
systems and aggregated and built on top of them.

Bad things happen when people try to wipe the slate clean
and try to replace previous system from scratch and after
the attempt things slide at least some of the way back to
where they were before.  The communists tried to do this on
very large scales, and yet the old Soviet block countries
today are now staunchly orthodox Christian populations
again.  And the Chinese did little to wipe out the old gods
and beliefs.

Instead, we need to find a means of building on top of these
systems and traditions and mythologies but with a world
model that corresponds more closely to empirical observed
reality.

** Consciousness

 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness][Consciousness]] | Wikipedia

Consciousness or the state of awareness of one self has more
baggage than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia][King Fahd]] on holiday.

Our conscious self-image is likely all there is to the soul.
And in many belief systems and cultures, our conscious
self-image is thought to be independent of the body and will
either transfer to another body after death or be
transported to another plane of existence where it will
continue on, as a incorporal spirit in place where we are
reunited with all of the other disembodied conscious
self-images.  Its such a bald-faced anthropomorphic concept
that it would be funny if it were not so nearly universally
believed in.  And the really bizzare thing is that many of
these belief systems claim that not only is the soul just
you without a mortal body, but that actions that you take on
earth determine if that eternity is spent in a bland boring
paradise or a twisted eternal punishment where mortal pain
is inflicted on an imortal non-corporal entity.  And this
lasts forever.

Why we find it so easy to believe in such preposterous
things is testimony to how weird and powerful conciousness
is.  We all know on at least an instinctive level that our
mind is not the same as our bodies -- that our thoughts do
not feel entirely tied to our senses and body.  It is not
obvious that our brains are constructing models of the world
that have reached a level of complexity that they are in
effect worlds in their own right.  The idea that our mind is
a ghost in the body's machine feels true.  That doesn't mean
that we are especially good at coming up with explanations
of what is happening, so we get the concept of souls -- and
if the soul is a ghost, there is no reason for the ghost to
not continue on without the body.  We /need/ such frameworks
to make sense of the world, to have a means of understanding
what we are, relative to each other and the world around us.

We just aren't very good at coming up with very imaginative
stories to explain it.

We project outselves into nature in the same way --
attributing human will and consciousness on natural forces
that are larger than we can control or understand.  We look
for meaning outside of ourselves and so project ourselves
into nature in the form of spirits, demons, ghosts, angels,
and gods.  And these become collective stories that become
cultural mythos that are the foundation for language and
social structures that go beyond hardwired instinctual group
bonding and behavior that predates even the limbic system.

It's astonishing to what lengths we still go to defend and
rationalize these beliefs.  It has been a cognitive blind
spot of nearly every human being that has ever lived until
recently, and even now rejecting such beliefs in conscious
dieties, and an afterlife is considered to be a grave taboo.

It is perhaps the last great example of belief in human
exceptionalism that is still a mainstream belief.  And as
machine cognition begins to evolve and take shape, these
systems will become conscious too, just like us.  Denying
that this is possible is one of the great themes of science
fiction, from the empathy tests in Philip K Dick's Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylon_(1978)][Cylons]] in
Battlestar Galactica.

It's been a common claim that only humans are self-conscious
but this is absurd.  Any cognitive process, is on some level
conscious, because cognitive processes create worlds which
are greater than the sum of their code.  If you can define a
cognitive system as a fnord, it is conscious.  Does that
mean it feels pain?  If it doesn't have a nervous system,
then no.  Can it love, or hate or be afraid?  If it doesn't
have a limbic system, then no.

It's also a common test of self-awareness that you must be
able to recognize an image or reflection of yourself as
you.  No...  In all cases these are anthropomorphic
projections of ourselves on other creatures.

Is this a justification for cruelty to animals?  Certainly
not, in fact, since we are, ourselves in position of
conciousness, and a nervous and limbic system then we should
be able to understand what other creatures that have these
things as well experience when they are mistreated.  But
again, you can have empathy for other creatures without
projecting every other human attribute on them as well.



** Experienced Reality as Illusion

Here we will explore how the brain constructs the illusion that we
percieve as reality.

#+begin_quote
In a nutshell, the brain builds models of the environment and the
body, which it uses to make hypotheses about the source of
sensations. The hypothesis that is deemed most likely becomes a
perception of external reality. Of course, the prediction could be
accurate or awry, and it is the brain’s job to correct for any errors
– after making a mistake it can modify its models to account better
for similar situations in the future.

But some models cannot be changed willy-nilly, for example, those of
our internal organs. Our body needs to remain in a narrow temperature
range around 37°C, so predictive processing achieves such control by
predicting that, say, the sensations on our skin should be in line
with normal body temperature. When the sensations deviate, the brain
doesn’t change its internal model, but rather forces us to move
towards warmth or cold, so that the predictions fall in line with the
required physiological state.
