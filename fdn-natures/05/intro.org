 I want to go back to the point where I said that this
 feeling will only happen when you're doing it for yourself
 . . . because there's another kind of thing that has been
 going on in the last few years that is, in fact, a very
 inflated sort of egocentrism, where you say, "My feelings
 are all that matters."  In an attempt to get away from all
 this very abstract, brutal stuff, people say, my feel- ings
 as artist are paramount, I'm going to do whatever I like,
 I'm going to produce the feelings in my paintings,
 sculptures, handmade houses, or whatever. The trouble is
 that this doesn't produce the goods either. True feeling
 only arises when you thoroughly and deeply recognize the
 structure of a situation that exists and you do the exact
 right thing at the right moment, to respond to that
 situation. Then it becomes invested with deep feeling. And
 the reason that speculation destroys this feeling, is that
 it constrains a situation so far that you are no longer
 free to respond to it correctly.

And I can state quite boldly what I think that motive has to
be.  [...] It's a ... kind of... union. [...]  I'm talking
about union of yourself with what the world is made of, or
union of yourself with other people, or union of yourself
and things. Most fundamentally, I'm talking about the motive
being union with the basic stuff the universe is made of, or
the basic stuff the world is made of.  There is no other way
to say it. Either you do it, or you don't.

Aesthetics

I think in the end what CA did in The Nature of Order is put
Aesthetics on a scientific footing.  That the nature of
beauty is order, but not just any order but certain kinds of
order which, as CA, likes to to say, create life.

Aesthetics has been taught as if it's less than a
fundemental part of the universe, that it's just tacked on
to make the world more pleasant, but has no function, per
say. CA's work puts beauty right smack in the middle of
the universe.  When you take a Big History perspectives of
tipping thresholds of complexity, beauty fits in
beautifully.  Complexity that becomes larger than the sum of
its parts is... life.

Beauty is not in the eye of the beholder.  It is objective,
not an opinion.  We have evolved a very subtle array of
cognitive pattern recognition systems for seeing beauty and
life in the world around us.  It is highly developed inate
ability -- it's hardwired into us.  Babies can see beauty.
Most certainly we learn to refine that ability and some have
a larger capacity than others, but I think there can be no
doubt that this is a fundamental part of our cognitive
survival toolkit.  Evolution couldn't have created such a
finely tuned tool if it wasn't directly related to
survival.  And I don't buy for one moment that this is
purely a mechanism for choosing mates.  It's deeper than
that.  It allows us to read the sky, and know if plants and
animals are healthy or sick -- life is inherently
beautiful, death is most certainly not.


---

It is likely that not only humans, but all complex life, has evolved
to process information about the world and instinctively identify
order when they see it.

We do this hierarchically, with a large array of pattern recognizers
at the bottom looking for primitive patterns.  If there is a positive
match that pattern is past up the hierarchy to a layer that looks for
patterns amid the recognized patterns -- this continues up layer by
layer until complex patterns,  that's an apple, I can eat it.  or that
is a big ass storm on the horizon, I better head into port.

Our brains are at base, pattern recognition machines.  Patterns in the
chaos are meaningful because order indicates a number of things:

  - potential food
  - potential danger
  
the better the order, the more complex the order, the more interesting
it is.

Humans combine this capibility with abstract thinking to create all
sorts of meta patterns, analogies, metaphors, good and evil, right and
wrong. 

And at the heart of this are concepts like beauty and transcendental
concepts of the divine -- which recognize patterns that are greater
than the sum of their parts.

-------

This is so deeply wired that they are core to happiness and well
being.  If we are surrounded by complex patterns we recognize as
beautiful and divine, it materially contributes to our quality of
life.

This is what most people are really talking about when they talk about
the divine, mystical or God.  They are seeing something that we are
designed to see, that we have no choice but seeing, with the deep
understanding that these things are bigger than we are, and are in
many cases beyond our ability to articulate or even understand.  Most
of us are content to appreciate....

Beauty is not decorative, it is not something you tack on at the end,
it is intrinsic to the very nature and process of human cognition.

I don't think we are special in this regard -- most of not all higher
level animals have a strong sense of beauty which is essential to
their well being as well.

This then lays the foundations for ESTRANGEMENT, where we come to
terms with how Modern Man has become estranged from this deep
understanding of beautiy, complexity and our relationship to the world
and our place in it. 
 

** Review and Summary of The Nature of Order

It took me a few months to read through all 4 volumes and I
will go through and read them again.  This is a monster
work that requires more than one reading.  The following is
a review on Amazon that does an excellent job of summing it
all up, though without reading the book, it doesn't help
much :)

The Nature of Order Volume 1: The Phenomenon of Life

Christopher Alexander

This is a book that will haunt you. You think you have
"seen" its purpose, and then you'll reread something, and
see new depths, reach new insights. You'll be frustrated you
don't have it with you to refer to at odd moments, when one
of its passages starts ringing bells, and illuminating bits
of your experience in new ways. Chris Alexander talks about
his journey over twenty five years to write the book, and
the efforts over five to ten years by students to grasp and
articulate and internalise his ideas.

But don't let these time scale put you off. It is also a
wonderfully illuminating book, and very clearly written. The
use of hundreds of contrasting photos of buildings, carpets,
ceramics, parking areas, and so on to illuminate the
concepts, and the presence of more or less life, is nothing
short of breath-taking. I found only one pair of pictures
leaving me feeling equivocal about what Chris was trying to
communicate.

If you are interested in art, architecture, design,
learning, cognition, religion, then you will gain immense
value from this book, whether from a furiously busy two
weeks on a loan from the library, or a purchase to treasure
and explore for the rest of your life.

The excerpts from the 476 pages identify and briefly explain
the fifteen properties, and attempt to give you a hint of
the power of this book.

.. the structure I identify as the foundation of all order
is also personal. As we learn to understand it, we shall see
that our own feeling, the feeling of what it is to be a
person, rooted, happy, alive in oneself, straightforward,
and ordinary, is itself inextricably connected with
order. 22.

Real life. .. is comfortable, rough around the edges, smooth
as if it had been rubbed together. This kind of life is the
ordinary life which is not connected to high art or
fashion. It has nothing to do with images. It occurs most
deeply when things are simply going well, where we are
having a good time, or when we are experiencing joy or
sorrow - when we experience the real. 38.

.. ordinary enough, or profound enough, to feel alive in
some degree. .. they are alive because they are - as far as
possible - concept free... They are vigorous and
straightforward, where the soul of the maker has entered the
thing - or where the ordinary processes of daily life,
uncontaminated by ideas or notions of what to do, has
unfolded in a way that we accept very easily. These things
make us comfortable because we recognize them as
genuine. 51.

THE FIFTEEN PROPERTIES:

1. LEVELS OF SCALE:

(can be) too far apart in scale to be coherent with each other. 147

2. STRONG CENTERS:

cumulative power of strong centers.. progressive quality. 153

3. BOUNDARIES:

If we apply the rule repeatedly, it says that every part, at
every level, has a boundary which is a thing in its own
right. This includes the boundaries themselves. They too
have boundaries, each of which is a thing in its own
right. What seems like one rule, then, is a pervasive
structural feature of enormous depth, which is in effect
applied dozens or hundreds of times, at different scales
throughout the thing. 162

4. ALTERNATING REPETITION:

The tired yet killing repetition comes from the fact that
what repeats is one-dimensional there is no alternation to
speak of, no living centers which repeat. And there are no
vital secondary centers repeating between the primary
ones. The difference between the kind of repetition which
has life, and supports life, and the kind which is banal,
always lies in this matter of alternation. 169

5. POSITIVE SPACE:

There is not a single space which is "leftover". ..every
shape is a strong center, and every space is made up in such
a way that it only has strong centers in its space, nothing
else besides. 176

6. GOOD SHAPE:

a shape which is itself, as a shape, made up of multiple
coherent centers. It is easiest to understand good shape as
a recursive rule. The recursive rule says that the elements
of any good shape are always good shapes themselves. 179

Partial list of properties required to make a good shape..

  - High degree of internal symmetries
  - Bilateral symmetry (almost always)
  - A well-marked center ( not necessarily at the geometric middle)
  - The spaces .. next to it are also positive
  - Strongly distinct from what surrounds it
  - Relatively compact (1:1, 1:2, occ 1:4)
  - Closure and complete feel 183

7. LOCAL SYMMETRIES:

over-simplified overall symmetry in buildings is most often
naïve and even brutal. 186. ... a large symmetry of the
simplified neoclassicist type rarely contributes to the life
of the thing because in any complex whole in the world,
there are nearly always complex, symmetrical forces at
work - matters of location, and context, and function -
which require that symmetry be broken. 187

.. the relative coherence of the patterns is an objective
matter of cognitive processing, independent of the person
who is judging, and independent of the particular kind of
experimental judgement which is used to measure it. .. but
the measure is subtle and refined. Even in the most coherent
patterns only (a few) of the segments are
symmetrical. 190,191

8. DEEP INTERLOCK AND AMBIGUITY:

situations where centers are "hooked" into their
surroundings. Eg arcade or gallery. 195 The space in the
gallery belongs to the outside world, and yet simultaneously
belongs to the building - thus causing a fusion of the
two. 197

9. CONTRAST:

Life cannot occur without differentiation. Unity can only be
created from distinctness. .. for the thing to be whole, the
contrast has to be pronounced. 200. but it is not forced

10. GRADIENTS:

Qualities vary slowly, subtly, gradually, across the extent
of the thing. ..One quality changes slowly across space, and
becomes another. ..centers .. varying in size, spacing,
intensity, and character. 205.

11. ROUGHNESS:

.. the seemingly rough solution - which seems superficially
inaccurate - is in fact more precise, not less so, because
it comes about as a result of paying attention to what
matters most, and letting go of what matters
less. .. another essential aspect of the property of
roughness is its abandon. Roughness can never be consciously
or deliberately created. Then it is merely contrived. 211

12. ECHOES:

a deep underlying similarity - a family resemblance - among
the elements, so deep that everything seems to be related,
and yet one doesn't quite know why, or what causes
it. ..depend on the angles, and families of angles, which
are prevalent in the design. 218

13. THE VOID:

This emptiness is needed, in some form, by every center,
large or small. It is the quiet that draws the center's
energy to itself, gives it the basis of its
strength. 225. .. there is a great lack of simple, silent,
empty, large, calm space. 225

14. SIMPLICITY AND INNER CALM:

geometrical simplicity and purity .. certain slowness,
majesty, quietness... it comes about when everything
unnecessary has been removed. 226. It comes from an
uncompromising steadfastness to function, following the
thing to its logical conclusion, refusing to be deterred by
convention. An extreme freedom. 227

15. NOT-SEPARATENESS:

when a thing lacks life, is not whole, we experience it as
being separate from the world and from itself. ..any center
which has deep life is connected, in feeling, to what
surrounds it, and is not cut off, isolated, or
separated. .. Those unusual things which have the power to
heal, the depth and inner light of real wholeness, are never
like this. .. 231. ..lack of abruptness, or sharpness.. 234.

The interplay of the properties:

The 15 properties are not independent. They overlap. In many
cases we need one of them to understand the definition of
another one. .. to define ALTERNATING REPETITION exactly, we
need to get clear that there is an alternation between
certain things or STRONG CENTERS which repeat... (which)
relies heavily on the GOOD SHAPE of the things that are
repeating.. 237. LEVELS OF SCALE ..are not discernible at
all , until we identify the things at different levels as
wholes... STRONG CENTERS and have GOOD SHAPE...which
contains powerful centers within the BOUNDARIES of the
shape. 237 It is the field of centers which is primary, not
the fifteen properties. Each of the properties describes one
of the possible ways in which centers can intensify each
other. Each one defines one type of spatial relationship
between two or more centers, and then shows how the mutual
intensification works in the framework of this
relationship. 241

Life will increase, or it will degenerate, according to the
degree to which the wholeness of the world is upheld, or
damaged, by human beings and human processes. 293

.. It is not easy to find what we really like, and it is by
no means automatic to be in touch with it. It takes effort,
hard work, and personal enlightenment to understand it and
to feel it. It requires liberation from opinions and
concepts and ego to experience deep liking. 316

My experiments show that, in general, people agree to a
remarkable extent about which objects are more, or less,
like their best, or better, or most whole selves. Very
surprisingly, it appears that this judgement is independent
of person-to-person differences and independent of
culture. .. Even if an observer is at first confused by the
question.. "Which of the two is more alive?", it allows him
to teach himself and to grow in his ability to judge the
matter. 319

We live in an era when people's likes and dislikes are
controlled by dubious intellectual fashions - often
supported by the media... It is only with maturity that we
learn to listen to our own heart and recognize what we truly
like. 342

A healthy human being is able, essentially, to solve
problems, to develop, to move towards objects of desire, to
contribute to the well-being of others in society, to create
value in the world, and to love, to be exhilarated, to
enjoy. The capacity to do these many positive things, to do
them well, and to do them freely, is natural. It arises by
itself. It cannot be created, artificially in a person, but
it needs to be released, given room. It does need to be
supported. It depends, simply, on the degree to which a
person is able to concentrate on these things, not on
others. 373

I hope these excerpts have done enough justice to the
richness and power of this book, and that they stimulate you
to buy a copy, study it with care, and then, in time, to use
it with flair. We are using it to help us design our
eco-village called Rosneath Farm.

Did some googling about Rosneath Farm, which looked like it
had great promise, but the owner of the land fucked it all
up and the project was mired in court battles for over five
years.

I believe the author of the review above was by Warwich
Rowell who seems to be the main person behind the project.
It also looked like he passed away....

One of the big problems with permaculture is the shear
amount of knowledge you need to be able to do it
successfully, and I don't think there are a lot of metrics
that have been pulled together that track how these systems
work and how much they can really produce.  Everything I
have seen so far is anecdotal.

Perhaps that's the agro app that I need to build on saltmine
-- a framework for managing polyculture farms and
communities.
